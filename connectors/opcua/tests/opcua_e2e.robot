Subscribed Node Pushes Value Changes
    [Documentation]    The ticks point is delivered by an OPC-UA subscription (monitored item),
    ...                not polling: the simulator increments it every second and each change
    ...                arrives as a pushed sample with a strictly increasing value.
    ...
    ...                This checks that push delivers the changes correctly (good quality,
    ...                strictly increasing). It does NOT by itself prove delivery is push --
    ...                polling would produce the same series -- which is what
    ...                "Subscribed Static Node Falls Silent After Its First Value" is for.

Sampling Interval Outpaces A Slow Poll Interval
    [Documentation]    opc3 polls once an hour but sets `sampling_interval = "200ms"` (contract
    ...                §3.1): its subscribed ticks point is sampled, and the device's subscription
    ...                published, every 200 ms. The simulator increments Ticks every second, so
    ...                each tick arrives within about a second. Were the poll interval still the
    ...                sampling interval, the subscription would publish once an hour and nothing
    ...                would arrive here. (python-asyncua reports value changes as they happen, so
    ...                with this simulator it is the derived publishing interval that decides; it
    ...                grants what is requested, uncapped.)

Every Change Of A Fast Node Arrives With The Default Queue Size
    [Documentation]    The simulator writes Burst five times in a row every second (10n .. 10n + 4),
    ...                faster than opc4's one-second publishing interval. With the default
    ...                `queue_size` of 16 the server queues every value, so all five of a burst
    ...                arrive as their own samples, in order.

Only The Latest Value Arrives With Queue Size One
    [Documentation]    opc5 reads the same node with `queue_size = 1`: the server keeps only the
    ...                latest value per publish, so no burst arrives whole. It shows that the
    ...                setting reaches the monitored item.

A Device With Thousands Of Points Subscribes
    [Documentation]    opc6 subscribes 5000 points. The connector creates the monitored items in
    ...                batches of 500. A single request of 5000 failed with the Rust build
    ...                (BadDecodingError past async-opcua's 1000-entry limit), and in the C build
    ...                most start values were dropped from a fixed 256-slot queue. Every monitored
    ...                item reports its value when it is created, so the first, a middle and the
    ...                last point all publish.

Subscribed Static Node Falls Silent After Its First Value
    [Documentation]    The decisive push test. temperature_pushed is subscribed to a node whose
    ...                value never changes, so a subscription delivers its initial value and
    ...                then reports nothing; polling would republish it every poll_interval
    ...                (1s here) for as long as the connector runs.
    ...
    ...                A rate check cannot make this distinction: the runtime passes each
    ...                point's resolved poll interval to the connector as the monitored item's
    ...                sampling interval, so push and polling run at the same rate by design.
    ...                Silence is the only behaviour polling cannot imitate.
    [Tags]    requires:subscribe
    # The initial notification arrives when the connector subscribes, i.e. at stack startup —

A Heartbeat Keeps A Static Subscribed Node Reporting

    ...                (contract §5.3). The subscription never pushes it again, so the samples
    ...                that keep coming are the runtime reading the node on demand once 3 s pass
    ...                without a publish: fresh reads, good quality, consecutive seq -- never the
    ...                last value replayed. This is what keeps a device whose values never change

Push Delivery Recovers After The Server Restarts
    [Documentation]    A subscribed point is OFF the polling schedule, so if push stops the
    ...                device goes silent and nothing else notices. When the server restarts,
    ...                the connector must drop the link, reconnect and re-arm the subscription

Push Delivery Recovers From A Silent Server
    [Documentation]    Freezing the server leaves the TCP connection ESTABLISHED and simply
    ...                stops every answer — the contract's silent-peer case (§8.1), but on the
    ...                PUSH path, where the conformance suite's B5 checks do not reach: every
    ...                point in the conformance config is `subscribe = false`. A subscribed
    ...                point is off the polling schedule, so if push stalls there is nothing
    ...                else to notice it.
    ...
    ...                Measured: this trips the client's request timeout
    ...                (connector.operation_timeout), which the connector reports as a dead
    ...                transport. It does NOT cover a subscription that dies while the session
    ...                stays healthy — see the note in impl/c/README.md; that path is guarded
    ...                by explicit checks but cannot be provoked with this simulator.
    ...
    ...                The push-only device has no polled point to time out, so for it only the
    ...                subscription's keep-alive window can reveal the silence: its link must
    ...                drop within that window. Thawed within the subscription's lifetime, the
    ...                server would otherwise resume the old subscription, so samples returning
