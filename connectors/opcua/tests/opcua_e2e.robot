Documentation       End-to-end tests for tedge-dot (opcua module) against a real

Subscribed Node Pushes Value Changes
    [Documentation]    The ticks point is delivered by an OPC-UA subscription (monitored item),
    ...                not polling: the simulator increments it every second and each change
    ...                arrives as a pushed sample with a strictly increasing value.
    ...
    ...                This checks that push delivers the changes correctly (good quality,
    ...                strictly increasing). It does NOT by itself prove delivery is push --
    ...                polling would produce the same series -- which is what
    ...                "Subscribed Static Node Falls Silent After Its First Value" is for.

    Should Be True    ${v2} > ${v1}

Subscribed Static Node Falls Silent After Its First Value
    [Documentation]    The decisive push test. temperature_pushed is subscribed to a node whose
    ...                value never changes, so a subscription delivers its initial value and
    ...                then reports nothing; polling would republish it every poll_interval
    ...                (1s here) for as long as the connector runs.
    ...
    ...                A rate check cannot make this distinction: the runtime passes each
    ...                point's resolved poll interval to the connector as the monitored item's
    ...                sampling interval, so push and polling run at the same rate by design.
    ...                Silence is the only behaviour polling cannot imitate.
    [Tags]    requires:subscribe
    # The initial notification arrives when the connector subscribes, i.e. at stack startup —
    # so look it up in the recorded traffic rather than waiting for a FRESH one, which is
    # precisely what will never come again.

A Heartbeat Keeps A Static Subscribed Node Reporting
    [Documentation]    temperature_heartbeat is subscribed to the same static node as
    ...                temperature_pushed, with `report = { on_change = true, max_interval = "3s" }`
    ...                (contract §5.3). The subscription never pushes it again, so the samples
    ...                that keep coming are the runtime reading the node on demand once 3 s pass
    ...                without a publish: fresh reads, good quality, consecutive seq -- never the
    ...                last value replayed. This is what keeps a device whose values never change
    ...                available in Cumulocity.

Push Delivery Recovers After The Server Restarts
    [Documentation]    A subscribed point is OFF the polling schedule, so if push stops the
    ...                device goes silent and nothing else notices. When the server restarts,
    ...                the connector must drop the link, reconnect and re-arm the subscription
    ...                — otherwise samples never come back.

Push Delivery Recovers From A Silent Server
    [Documentation]    Freezing the server leaves the TCP connection ESTABLISHED and simply
    ...                stops every answer — the contract's silent-peer case (§8.1), but on the
    ...                PUSH path, where the conformance suite's B5 checks do not reach: every
    ...                point in the conformance config is `subscribe = false`. A subscribed
    ...                point is off the polling schedule, so if push stalls there is nothing
    ...                else to notice it.
    ...
    ...                Measured: this trips the client's request timeout
    ...                (connector.operation_timeout), which the connector reports as a dead
    ...                transport. It does NOT cover a subscription that dies while the session
    ...                stays healthy — see the note in impl/c/README.md; that path is guarded
    ...                by explicit checks but cannot be provoked with this simulator.
    ...
    ...                The push-only device has no polled point to time out, so for it only the
    ...                subscription's keep-alive window can reveal the silence: its link must
    ...                drop within that window. Thawed within the subscription's lifetime, the
    ...                server would otherwise resume the old subscription, so samples returning
