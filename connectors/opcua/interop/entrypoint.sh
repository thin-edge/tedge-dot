# Entrypoint of the connector in the OPC UA INTEROP stack (docker-compose.yaml).
#
# Two jobs before the connector starts:
#
#  1. Create the application certificate up front with `tedge-dot pki create` and export it
#     into the volume ref-strict mounts at /app/certs. That server copies certs/trusted/* into
#     its trust list AT STARTUP and does not auto-accept anything, so our certificate has to
#     exist before it is (re)started -- the suite restarts it to make the trust take effect.
#  2. Use the configuration ns-resolver rendered, which carries the server's real namespace
#     index.
#
# The PKI directory is the packaged default, /var/lib/tedge-dot/opcua/pki.
