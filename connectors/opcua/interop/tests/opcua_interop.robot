Documentation       Interoperability with a third-party OPC UA stack: the connector against the
...                 OPC Foundation UA-.NETStandard reference server (php-opcua/uanetstandard-
...                 test-suite, MIT). Everything else we test against is a server this project
...                 wrote, so a misreading of the specification is invisible to it; this suite
...                 exists to catch that.
...
...                 One device per situation (connectors/opcua/interop/connector.toml.in, whose
...                 namespace index is resolved at startup by resolve-ns.py).
...
...                 Run via:  just test-interop opcua   (and just test-interop-c opcua)

*** Test Cases ***
Every Supported Policy And Mode Connects
    [Documentation]    Each policy the connector supports, negotiated with a real server, and
    ...                the effective policy and mode reported back in the link status.
    ...                Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep had never been exercised positively before: our own
    ...                simulators only ever offered it to produce a "no matching endpoint"
    ...                reason.

Unsecured Channel Connects And Reads Every Datatype
    [Documentation]    Policy None, and one point per datatype the connector claims, read from
    ...                the reference address space.
    Wait For Link Status    plain    connected
    Sample Should Be    plain    double    ${DOUBLE}
    Sample Should Be    plain    bool      ${1}
    Sample Should Be    plain    int32     ${-100000}
    Sample String Should Be    plain    string    Hello OPC UA

Deprecated Policies Connect With The Opt-In
    [Documentation]    Basic256 and Basic128Rsa15 had only ever been covered by configuration-
    ...                validation unit tests; here they run against a server that really offers
    ...                them. The refusal WITHOUT `allow_deprecated_security` stays a
    ...                configuration concern, covered by connector-opcua's own unit tests --
    ...                it never reaches a server, so it does not belong in an interop suite.

    Device Connects With    legacy-b128    Basic128Rsa15      sign_and_encrypt

Username Identity Is Accepted And Rejected As The Server Decides
    [Documentation]    The reference server's own user database (config/users.json). The
    ...                rejection must name the identity, never the password.
    Wait For Link Status    user    connected
    Sample Should Be    user    double    ${DOUBLE}

    Should Not Contain    ${reason}    not-the-password
    ${logs}=    Connector Log
    Should Not Contain    ${logs}    not-the-password

Weak Server Certificate Is Refused With Its Key Length
    [Documentation]    UA-.NETStandard auto-generates its application certificate with a
    ...                1024-bit RSA key (upstream says so in Program.cs), which Basic256Sha256
    ...                forbids. The refusal must name the key length and must NOT tell the
    ...                operator to run `tedge-dot pki trust`: trusting a certificate does not
    ...                make its key longer, so that advice would send them in a circle.
    ...
    ...                This is why the quarantine-then-trust flow is not exercised here; it
    ...                stays covered by the secured e2e suite, whose genpki vectors are
    ...                2048-bit.
    ${reason}=    Link Is Refused    tofu    certificate invalid:
    Should Contain    ${reason}    1024
    Should Contain    ${reason}    Basic256Sha256
    Should Not Contain    ${reason}    tedge-dot pki trust

    Should Not Contain    ${rejected}    ${thumbprint}

Server That Refuses Our Certificate Says So
    [Documentation]    ref-strict does not auto-accept an unknown client certificate, and we
    ...                trust it (trust_any), so the only thing that can fail is its judgement of
    ...                us. Both directions of distrust arrive as the same status code, so this
    ...                is the one case that tells the categories apart on a real server.
    ${reason}=    Link Is Refused    strict    application certificate rejected:
    ${own}=    Own Thumbprint
    Should Contain    ${reason}    ${own}
    Should Contain    ${reason}    tedge-dot pki export
    # Our own distrust of a server must NOT be reported this way.
    Should Not Start With    ${reason}    certificate untrusted:

Server Trusts Us After Our Certificate Is Added
    [Documentation]    entrypoint.sh exported our certificate into the volume ref-strict mounts
    ...                at /app/certs; that server reads its trust list only at startup, so the
    ...                trust takes effect on restart.
    [Setup]    Link Is Refused    strict    application certificate rejected:
    Restart Stack Service    ref-strict
    Wait For Link Status    strict    connected

Policies We Do Not Implement Are Listed
    [Documentation]    A server offering only elliptic-curve policies must produce a listed
    ...                refusal naming them as the server advertised them, not an empty list, and
    ...                must not take the connector down with it.
    ${reason}=    Link Is Refused    ecc    no matching endpoint:
    Should Contain    ${reason}    ECC_nistP256
    Should Contain    ${reason}    ECC_nistP384
    # The other devices keep working while that one fails.
    Sample Should Be    plain    double    ${DOUBLE}

Server Advertising 0.0.0.0 Is Reachable
    [Documentation]    The reference server advertises `opc.tcp://0.0.0.0:4840/...` as its
    ...                endpoint URL (BuildBaseAddresses hardcodes it). A client that dials what
    ...                the server advertises cannot connect at all -- asyncua gets
    ...                BadServerUriInvalid -- so this is the real-world case for keeping the
    ...                configured address.
    ${link}=    Wait For Link Status    plain    connected
    Should Be Equal    ${{ json.loads($link)["info"]["endpoint"] }}

Endpoint Without A Resource Path Connects
    [Documentation]    The discovery instance serves an endpoint URL with no resource path.
    Wait For Link Status    discovery    connected
    Sample Should Be    discovery    double    ${DOUBLE}

Subscription Delivers Changes From The Reference Server
    [Documentation]    TestServer/Dynamic/Counter is updated by the server on a timer, so the
    ...                push path can be told apart from polling: two different values must
    ...                arrive without that point being polled.
    Wait For Link Status    dynamic    connected
    ${first}=    Wait For Sample    te/device/dynamic/ot/${PROTOCOL}/sample/counter

    ${second}=    Wait For Fresh Sample Differing From    dynamic    counter    ${first}
    Should Not Be Equal    ${first}    ${second}

Session Survives Secure Channel Token Renewal
    [Documentation]    ref-token grants a 30s secure channel token, so staying connected across
    ...                this test means the channel was renewed rather than re-established.
    [Timeout]    5 minutes
    Wait For Link Status    token    connected
    ${before}=    Connector Log
    Sleep    75s    reason=two 30s token lifetimes, so at least two renewals fall inside
