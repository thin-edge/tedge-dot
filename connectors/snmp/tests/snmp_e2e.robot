Documentation       End-to-end tests for the tedge-dot SNMP connector: polling (GET and GETBULK), SET
...                 writes, and notifications (traps and informs, v1/v2c/v3, direct and through a
...                 trusted forwarder). The pysnmp `agent*` containers are the polled devices (seeds
...                 in connectors/snmp/agent/agent.py); net-snmp in `simulator` sends notifications
...                 (connectors/snmp/sim/send-trap); `stranger` is configured as no device;
...                 `forwarded` sends through the snmptrapd `forwarder`. The flows runner turns
...                 notifications into events and alarms. No cloud (Cumulocity) is involved.
...
...                 Every notification is triggered by the test that asserts on it, and each wait
...                 only accepts messages that arrived after that trigger.
...
...                 Run via:  just test-e2e snmp   /   just test-e2e-c snmp

An Unauthenticated v3 Trap Is Dropped And The Device Keeps Working
    [Documentation]    The device is configured authPriv, so a noAuthNoPriv trap carrying its
    ...    user name -- which travels in the clear in every v3 message -- must be dropped, and
    ...    the device must keep accepting properly authenticated traps afterwards.
    ...
    ...    What this case does NOT establish: every trap device in connector.toml pins
    ...    `engine_id`, and the simulator sends this trap from that same engine, so the
    ...    receiver's engine-LEARNING branch is never reached and the case passes with or
    ...    without the fix that guards it. Discriminating that needs a device whose engine is
    ...    unpinned when the case runs (see TODO.md); the property is covered at unit level by
    ...    `an_unauthenticated_notification_teaches_an_authenticated_user_nothing`, which does
    ...    fail without the fix.
