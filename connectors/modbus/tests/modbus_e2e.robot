A Disabled Device Is Left Out Of The Connector
    [Documentation]    `enabled = false` (§3.3) takes a device out of the configuration: plc-off is
    ...                never connected, polled or advertised, and the point library it names — not
    ...                installed — is not even looked up, so the connector starts all the same.

Capability Descriptor Carries The Point Labels
    [Documentation]    A point's `name`/`description` (§3.1) are static, so they are published
    ...                once in the retained capability descriptor (§7) rather than echoed in
    ...                every sample. Only labelled points appear — no entry means the id is the
    ...                label — and here they come from the point library, which is where a
    ...                shared list documents itself once for every instance that references it.

Library Point Keeps Its Definition Under An Inline Override
    [Documentation]    level_f32 comes from the point library points.d/modbus/plc-sim.toml and is
    ...                overridden inline with `unit = "m"` alone (contract §3.4). The resolved

Reads A Point From A Path-Referenced Library
    [Documentation]    connector.toml references its second library by absolute path rather
    ...                than by name (contract §3.4). Both forms are legal in a config file —
    ...                and the define-device test below depends on this one being present, since
    ...                a pre-existing path reference must not stop the management verbs working.

Writes A Holding Register And Reads It Back
    [Documentation]    A write command sets holding register 3 to 4242; the next sample reflects it.
    ...                 Runs after the uint16 read assertion (the stack is recreated per run).
    Publish Message    ${CMD_PREFIX}/reg-1    {"status":"init","point":"temp_u16","value":4242}    retain=True

Writes A Label To A Mapped Point
    [Documentation]    A point with a value map (§4.3) publishes the label of its register's code,
    ...                with the code as source_value. A write of a label reaches the register as
    ...                its code; the result echoes the label, and both points on the register
    ...                read back the new value.

    Should Be Equal As Numbers    ${source}    1234

A Mapped Point Refuses A Label It Cannot Write
    [Documentation]    `default` catches every unlisted code, so it has no code of its own to write:
    ...                the write fails with the accepted labels, and the register keeps its value.
    Publish Message    ${CMD_PREFIX}/map-2    {"status":"init","point":"state","value":"other"}    retain=True
    ${result}=    Wait For Message Containing    ${CMD_PREFIX}/map-2    "status":"failed"    timeout=${SAMPLE_TIMEOUT}

Samples Carry The Point Access And The Device Type
    [Documentation]    Every sample echoes the point's declared access and the device's type, so
    ...                flows can tell writable points (parameters) apart and name their parameter
    ...                set without reading the config file.

Write Batch Writes Several Points In One Command
    [Documentation]    One write-batch request writes a register and a coil in order and reports
    ...                a per-point result; the next samples reflect both values.

Write Batch Stops At The First Failure And Reports What Was Applied
    [Documentation]    A batch with an unknown point fails, but the result lists the write that

    Publish Message    ${BATCH_PREFIX}/batch-2

Writing The Coil And A Register Leaves Each Other Alone
    [Documentation]    The coil and temp_u16 are independent: a write to one never changes the other.
    ...                A Cumulocity parameter update sends back every key of its set, so it rewrites
    ...                temp_u16 alongside the coil. When the coil was bit 0 of temp_u16's register,
    ...                that rewrite reverted the coil on the next poll. The values are picked so the
    ...                coil and the register's low bit disagree, and both differ from before.

    ...                have to cover all of them. The second config here is another device type on
