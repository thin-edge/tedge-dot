Documentation       SIGHUP reloads the connector configuration without restarting the service —
...                 what `systemctl reload tedge-dot` sends through the unit's ExecReload. A change
...                 to the config directory triggers the same reload on its own (the last tests,
...                 which never send SIGHUP; openspec change config-file-watch-reload).
...
...                 Runs against the multi-device stack (docker-compose.multi-device.yaml): one
...                 process running a directory of ten connector configs, one per simulated device,
...                 which is the layout a reload has to handle file by file:
...                 - every running connector re-reads its own file and applies what changed in
...                 place, while a connector whose file is unchanged is left alone;
...                 - a new file starts a connector, and a removed file stops one;
...                 - a file that cannot be used is reported and the running configuration kept;
...                 - a change a connector cannot adopt in place (its service name) restarts it.
...
...                 The process is PID 1 of the connector container: the entrypoint execs it.

A Changed Config Is Applied In Place
    [Documentation]    A point added to plc-3's file is sampled after a reload, without restarting
    ...                its connector: its service health never goes down. The connectors whose files
    ...                did not change are left alone entirely — their devices are not reconnected,
    ...                so no link status is published for them.

A New Config File Starts A Connector
    [Documentation]    A file added to the directory starts a connector on the next reload (plc-11,

A Removed Config File Stops Its Connector
    [Documentation]    A file removed from the directory stops its connector on the next reload: the

An Unusable Config Keeps The Running Connector
    [Documentation]    A file that no longer loads is reported, and its connector keeps running on

A Changed Service Name Restarts The Connector
    [Documentation]    The service name addresses a connector's MQTT session, last will and
    ...                management topic, so a changed one cannot be adopted in place: the connector
    ...                restarts under the new name — the old service goes down, the new one comes up
    ...                — and polls its device again.

A Config That Could Not Start Is Tried Again On Reload

A Config Added To The Directory Starts Its Connector Without A Reload
    [Documentation]    A new file is applied without SIGHUP: its connector reports its service up

An Invalid Config Saved Without A Reload Leaves Its Connector Running
