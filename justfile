# reason, rather than quietly dropped or (worse) passing for the wrong reason.
#
# Every capability name a `requires:<capability>` tag may use. Declaring the vocabulary in one
# place is what turns a mistyped tag into an error instead of a test that quietly runs against
# a build that cannot pass it (see `just check-capability-tags`).
