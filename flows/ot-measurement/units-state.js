// ot-measurement publishes each measurement's units retained on <measurement topic>/meta, as one
// message holding every series of that topic. It cannot read them back, because the mapper drops
// a flow's output to its own input topics to prevent loops. This flow subscribes in its place and
// records each message in the mapper-wide store:
//
//   "ot-measurement-units:<meta topic>" -> { "<fragment>.<series>": { "unit": "..." }, ... }
//
// After a mapper restart the broker replays the retained messages, so ot-measurement merges a new
// unit into the units already standing. Otherwise it would republish only the series it has seen
// since the restart, and drop the units of points that rarely send a sample. An empty message
// (cleared topic) or one that is not a JSON object is recorded as no units.
