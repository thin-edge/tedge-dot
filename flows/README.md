# thin-edge.io flows for OT connectors

These flows convert between the **OT connector format** (the connector's `sample`/`cmd`/`status`
envelopes on `te/device/<device>/ot/<protocol>/...`) and the **thin-edge.io data model**
(`m`/`a`/`cmd` and entity registration on `te/device/<device>///...`, see the
[MQTT API](https://thin-edge.github.io/thin-edge.io/references/mqtt-api/)).

They are **protocol-neutral**: every flow consumes the generic OT Connector Contract envelopes, so
the *same flow set* maps `modbus`, `opcua`, or any other connector built on the SDK. The
measurement group, child-device type and alarm group are derived from the connector's
`protocol`/topic, so a new protocol needs no new flows.

The connector is a "dumb" driver: it reads/writes the OT protocol, decodes primitives and applies
the per-signal properties declared on each point (linear scaling and engineering unit). All
naming, alarms, registration and operation shaping live here, in
[thin-edge.io flows](https://thin-edge.github.io/thin-edge.io/extend/flows/) — small JavaScript
modules that run inside a mapper and are hot-reloaded without restarts.

## The flows

| Flow | Direction | Reads | Emits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [ot-measurement](ot-measurement/) | OT → thin-edge | `ot/<protocol>/sample/<point>` | `m/<group>` measurement |
| [ot-alarm](ot-alarm/) | OT → thin-edge | `sample/<point>` (`meta.alarm`), `status/link`; or one `m/<group>` series | `a/<type>` alarm, retained: raised and cleared |
| [ot-event](ot-event/) | OT → thin-edge | `sample/<point>` (`meta.event`); or one `m/<group>` series | `e/<type>` event |
| [ot-registration](ot-registration/) | OT → thin-edge | `ot/<protocol>/status/link` | `te/device/<device>//` child registration (+ optional `twin/<fragment>`) |
| [ot-command-forward](ot-command-forward/) | thin-edge → OT | `cmd/ot_<verb>/<id>` (incl. `parameter_update`) | `ot/<protocol>/cmd/<verb>/<id>`, or `service/<service>/ot/cmd/<verb>/<id>` for management verbs |
| [ot-command-result](ot-command-result/) | OT → thin-edge | `ot/<protocol>/cmd/<verb>/<id>`, `service/<service>/ot/cmd/<verb>/<id>` | `cmd/ot_<verb>/<id>` (or the `origin.command`) |
| [ot-parameter-state](ot-parameter-state/) | OT → thin-edge | `sample/<point>`, `cmd/write*/<id>`, `status/link` | `twin/<set>` |

The two `ot-command-*` flows form a bidirectional, **verb-neutral** bridge: *forward* turns a
thin-edge command into a connector command request; *result* mirrors the connector's `executing` →
`successful`/`failed` transitions back so the thin-edge command (and any bound cloud operation)
completes. They are split into two flows because a single flow may not both consume and produce
on its own input topics (the mapper drops such outputs to prevent loops).

The thin-edge command type maps to a connector verb by dropping the `ot_` prefix and turning `_`
into `-`. The verbs cover the legacy Cumulocity operations (see the
[migration guide](../../doc/proposal/migration/migration-guide.md)):

| thin-edge command | connector verb | replaces (legacy operation) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ot_write` | `write` | `c8y_SetRegister` |
| `ot_write_coil` | `write-coil` | `c8y_SetCoil` |
| `ot_set_config` | `set-config` | `c8y_ModbusConfiguration`, `c8y_SerialConfiguration` |
| `ot_define_device` | `define-device` | `c8y_ModbusDevice`, `c8y_Coils`, `c8y_Registers` |
| `ot_remove_device` | `remove-device` | — |
| `parameter_update` | `write-batch` (reshaped by `ot-command-forward`) | `c8y_ParameterUpdate` (device parameters; template owned by tedge-parameter-plugin) |

The `write` verb is implemented by the protocol module; the `set-config`/`define-device`/
`remove-device` management verbs are implemented once by the SDK runtime (it owns the connector
configuration), so every connector supports them. `ot-command-forward` subscribes to an explicit
allow-list of `ot_*` command types (add a line to its `flow.toml` to support a new verb).

Management verbs change one connector instance's configuration, so `ot-command-forward` sends
them to that instance's service topic (`te/device/main/service/<service>/ot/cmd/<verb>/<id>`,
contract §6.3). The service is the command's `service` field, else `tedge-dot-<protocol>` — the
default `service_name` of a connector config — so name the service whenever the connector's config
sets its own `service_name`, e.g. when a gateway runs several connectors of one protocol. A
command whose `service` is not a plain topic level is **not forwarded**: the flow cannot fail it
(its output would match its own input), so it stays pending.

**Device parameters** (see [RFC 0003](../doc/rfc/0003-parameter-writes.md)): writable points are
parameters. `ot-parameter-state` keeps one retained twin fragment per *parameter set*
(`te/device/<device>///twin/<set>`, keyed by point id or by the key a point names) current from the samples (which echo each
point's `access`) and from acknowledged writes. Parameter values — in the twin and in a write — are
in the point's engineering units (after its `transform`); the SDK converts a write back to the raw
value before the connector encodes it (contract §4.2). A point can name its own key in the fragment with
`meta.parameter.key`, keeping an id that is unique on the device:

```toml
[[point]]
id       = "firmwareVersion"
datatype = "string"
address  = { node_id = "ns=1;s=FirmwareVersion" }
meta     = { parameter = { key = "firmware.version" }, measurement = false }
```

publishes `te/device/<device>///twin/firmware` as `{"version": "..."}`: a key `<set>.<key>` names
the set and the key at once, while a key without a dot (`key = "version"`) stays in the point's
usual set. `ot-command-forward` turns
an edit of that key back into a write of `firmwareVersion`. The mapping comes from the connector's
retained capability descriptor (`parameter_keys`) as well as the point's samples, so it holds right
after a mapper restart and for write-only points too; `tedge-dot describe` refuses two points of a
device with the same key in a set. It also drops a point from the twin when the
retained link status no longer lists it (a reload removed it) or its latest sample no longer
names that set, and clears a set left empty: Cumulocity sends the whole fragment back with an
edit, so a stale key would fail every update of the set. `ot-command-forward` reshapes a
`parameter_update` command — the command type of the
[tedge-parameter-plugin](https://github.com/thin-edge/tedge-parameter-plugin), whose
`c8y_ParameterUpdate.template` maps the Cumulocity operation onto it — into ONE connector
`write-batch`, and `ot-command-result` completes it through the batch request's `origin.command`.
The plugin's own workflow only serves the main device (tedge-agent runs workflows for its own
entity only), so on OT child devices the flows are the sole handler and no second template is
needed: the c8y mapper binds templates per fragment name, so two templates for
`c8y_ParameterUpdate` could never coexist.
A set name is a tenant-wide identifier in the cloud, so it is derived from the **device type**
(echoed in every sample and on the retained link status) rather than from the protocol:
`<type, else protocol>_<meta.parameter.group, default "control">_parameters`, e.g.
`acme_meter_v2_control_parameters`. Both `group` and `set` accept a list, so one point can be in
several sets and its value is published to each of their fragments. `meta.parameter.set` still
names a set outright, and the flow's `default_set` param forces one name for everything. `tedge-dot describe` derives the same
names from the same configuration and renders them as Cumulocity DTM definitions for a tenant
admin to register — see [RFC 0005](../doc/rfc/0005-device-types-and-parameter-sets.md).
A parameter is still an ordinary signal otherwise, so by default its samples also become
measurements through `ot-measurement`. To keep its value on the twin fragment only, and not also
as a measurement series, set `meta.measurement = false` on the point: it stays a parameter and
keeps being sampled. Alarms and events declared on the point (below) still work: they are
evaluated on its samples, not its measurements.

**Alarms and events** are declared per signal on the point's `meta`, next to its address — for
whatever value a sample carries, a string or a boolean as much as a number:

```toml
[[device.point]]
id       = "pump_state"
datatype = "string"
address  = { node_id = "ns=2;s=PumpState" }
meta     = { measurement = false, alarm = { type = "pump_fault", severity = "critical", when = { equals = "FAULT" } }, event = { type = "pump_state_changed", text = "Pump is {value}" } }
```

`ot-alarm` publishes the alarm, retained, while `when` holds — `equals` / `not_equals` a value or
a list of values, `above` / `below` a number with an optional `hysteresis`; without `when`, while
the value is `true` — and clears it with an empty retained message. `ot-event` raises an event on
every change of the value or, with `when`, each time the condition starts to hold — or, with
`every = true`, for every sample: what a signal whose samples are occurrences needs, such as an
SNMP trap point, where two identical linkDown notifications are two events. `alarm` and
`event` may each be a list; the header of each flow's `main.js` documents every key. The alarm
is retained but the flows' memory is not. After a mapper restart `ot-alarm` learns from the
retained alarms which ones are still standing (through its companion flow,
`ot-alarm/alarm-state.toml`), so it does not raise them again — Cumulocity would count a repeat
as a new occurrence. Any other alarm is settled by its first reading, which publishes it raised
or cleared, so an alarm whose condition went away in the meantime does not stay active. An alarm
is also cleared when its point stops declaring it or is removed from the configuration (seen
while the mapper runs; removing a whole device leaves its alarms standing). An alarm type is
unique per device: when two points declare the same one, the first keeps it. An event, by contrast, takes the
first reading after a restart as its baseline, so a restart never reports a change that did not
happen — and a change made while the mapper was down is not reported.

Both flows act on the samples as published, so a point's reporting policy (`report`, see
[Reducing data volume](../doc/reducing-data-volume.md#alarms-and-events)) applies to them too:
keep a deadband smaller than the alarm's `hysteresis`, and give no change filter (and, for a
pushed point, no heartbeat) to a point whose event uses `every = true`.

By default `ot-measurement` names the measurement group after the sample's `protocol`
(`m/modbus`, `m/opcua`, ...) and `ot-registration` types the child device as `<protocol>-device`.
Override either via each flow's `params.toml`, where `ot-alarm` / `ot-event` can also watch one
`m/<group>` series for a threshold or for changes (their measurement mode, off until `series` is
set).

To remap individual signals to specific groups/series with a single flow instance, name the
connector points with a separator and set `point_separator` (e.g. `"."`): the point id
`Environment.Temperature` then becomes group `Environment`, series `Temperature`. Explicit
`group`/`series` still win, and an empty `point_separator` (the default) leaves dotted ids
untouched. For per-signal shaping beyond this convention, run one filtered instance per signal
(set `point`) or copy the flow and customise `main.js`.

`ot-measurement` also covers the legacy register mapping option of batching a device's series
into one measurement (`combine` + `combine_interval`). Publishing only on a change, beyond a
deadband, at most so often or once a value has settled is the point's `report` table in the
connector config: the SDK runtime applies it before a sample is published, so every flow sees the
reduced stream, and it adds a heartbeat for flat signals. See
[Reducing data volume](../doc/reducing-data-volume.md). `ot-measurement`'s own `on_change`,
`deadband`, `min_interval` and `debounce` settings (and their `meta.*` overrides) still work but
are **deprecated**; do not use them together with `report`.
Linear scaling
(`multiplier`/`divisor`/`decimal_shift`/`offset`) is a per-point property declared on the
connector point (applied by the SDK), so the sample already carries the scaled value.
`ot-registration` can additionally publish the connector's device descriptor as a digital-twin
fragment (`twin_fragment`, e.g. `c8y_ModbusDevice`).

```

## Configure

Each flow ships a `params.toml.template` documenting its settings. To customise, copy it to
`params.toml` in the same directory and edit. With the defaults, `ot-measurement` maps every
good numeric point into an `m/<protocol>` measurement whose series is the point id — zero config.

## Test (offline, no broker/device/cloud)

```sh
just test-flows          # runs flows/test-flows.sh (covers modbus and opcua samples)
# or a single case:
echo '[te/device/plc1/ot/modbus/sample/level_f32] {"ts":"2026-05-30T10:00:00.000Z","device":"plc1","protocol":"modbus","point":"level_f32","mode":"typed","datatype":"float32","value":404.17,"value_repr":"number","raw":"43ca 15c3","quality":"good","addr":{}}' \
  | tedge flows test --flows-dir ./flows/ot-measurement/
```

## Deploy

The `tedge-dot` packages (both the Rust and the C build) already ship these flows, so on a
packaged install there is nothing to copy. All of them are deployed **active**, into the
Cumulocity mapper's flows directory:

```
/etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-measurement/
/etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-registration/
/etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-command-forward/
/etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-command-result/
/etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-parameter-state/
/etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-alarm/
/etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-event/
```

`ot-alarm` and `ot-event` do nothing until a point declares an alarm or an event, so they need no
settings. Only their measurement mode — one `m/<group>` series watched for a threshold or for
changes — is configured, in a `params.toml`:

```sh
sudo cp /etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-alarm/params.toml.template \
        /etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-alarm/params.toml
sudo -u tedge $EDITOR /etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/ot-alarm/params.toml
```

Earlier packages shipped these two inert in `/usr/share/tedge-dot/flows/`. A copy enabled from
there by hand is replaced by the packaged flow on upgrade, and the `params.toml` next to it is
kept. Its measurement mode keeps working only if that `params.toml` sets `series`: the packaged
template no longer names one, so a copy that ran on the template's example series (`temp_u16`
for `ot-alarm`, `value` for `ot-event`) or on the flow's old built-in default (`value`) goes
quiet until `series` is set.

Either way the mapper picks the change up and hot-reloads — no restart. Only the flow logic
(`flow.toml`, `main.js`) and the `params.toml.template` are packaged; the `params.toml` you write
next to them is not, so a package upgrade replaces the logic and leaves your settings alone.

From a source checkout, or to target a different mapper, copy the directories yourself:

```sh
sudo cp -Ra flows/ot-measurement /etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/
sudo cp -Ra flows/ot-registration /etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/
sudo cp -Ra flows/ot-parameter-state /etc/tedge/mappers/c8y/flows/
# ...and the others as needed
```

Or package a flow as a `*.tar.gz` and install it via Cumulocity software management using the
`<mapper>/<flow>` name (e.g. `c8y/ot-measurement`), as described in the
[flows guide](https://thin-edge.github.io/thin-edge.io/extend/flows/#installing-flows).
