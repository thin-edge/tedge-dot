// A *parameter* is a point whose `access` (echoed in every sample) permits writes, or that opts
// in via meta.parameter (meta.parameter = false opts a writable point out). Parameters are
// grouped into *sets*; each set is one twin fragment — the same sets `tedge-dot describe`
// declares in the cloud, which is why the naming rule below has to match the SDK's
// (impl/rust/crates/sdk/src/descriptor.rs, impl/c/sdk/src/descriptor.c):
//
//   <device type, else the protocol>_<meta.parameter.group, default "control">_parameters
//
// `group` (and `set`) may be a list, so one point can belong to several sets — operators group
// signals by what they are for — and its value is published to each of their fragments.
//
// The device type is echoed in every sample and on the link status (contract §3.1/§5), so the
// flow never needs the connector's configuration file. meta.parameter.set bypasses the rule and
// is used verbatim.
//
// Inside a set, a point's value is published under its *key*: the point id, or
// meta.parameter.key when the point names one — so a point can keep an id that is unique on the
// device (`firmwareVersion`) and still be `version` in its `firmware` fragment:
// `key = "firmware.version"` names the set and the key at once, and a key without a dot stays in the
// point's usual set. The key comes from
// the connector's retained capability descriptor (parameter_keys, contract §7), so it is known
// before the point samples — right after a mapper restart, and for a write-only point, which
// never samples — and from the point's samples. This flow records which point each key of a set
// belongs to, and ot-command-forward uses that to turn an edit of the fragment back into point
// writes. Two points of a device sharing a key in a set is a configuration `describe` refuses;
// here the first to claim the key keeps it. Once that point leaves the set or is removed, the key is
// free, and the other point takes it at its own next sample, write, descriptor or link status.
//
// A *literal* parameter (meta.parameter.fragment = "<name>") is published as the fragment itself:
// `twin/pump_speed` carries `42`, not `{ "<key>": 42 }`. Internally it is a set named after the
// fragment holding one reserved key, "" — which no configured key can be, since a key is a
// non-empty identifier — so it is claimed, placed, pruned and released exactly like a key. A set
// never holds both shapes: whichever point claims the name first keeps it (`describe` refuses the
// configuration). Its fragment comes from the descriptor's parameter_keys ({ point, fragment }) and
// from its samples, like a declared key.
//
// Where values come from:
//   * readable parameters: every good sample (so the twin follows the device, including
//     changes made locally on the PLC/HMI);
//   * write-only parameters (access = "write"): the last acknowledged write — the device cannot
//     be read back, so this is the *commanded* state, not a measured one. It is unknown (absent
//     from the twin) until the first successful write after the mapper started, and it lands in
//     the sets its declared key names, else in the default set (no sample ever tells us its
//     meta);
//   * read/write parameters are also updated optimistically from a successful write, then
//     confirmed/corrected by the next sample.
//
// Where values go away — a fragment carrying a point the device no longer has is not just
// untidy: Cumulocity sends the whole fragment back with an operator's edit, so one stale key
// fails every parameter update of that set:
//   * a point removed from the configuration: the link status lists the device's configured
//     points (contract §8) and is republished whenever the configuration changes, so every
//     point missing from it is dropped from each set — and releases every key it claimed, with or
//     without a value — and a retained write result replayed for it afterwards is ignored. The
//     lists are kept per protocol and a point stays while any of them has it; while one protocol
//     serving the device has not listed its points (a connector that predates the list), nothing
//     is dropped for that device at all;
//   * a point that left a set (its group, its type or its access changed): its next sample names
//     the sets it is in now, and it is dropped from the others;
//   * a point whose key changed: its next description (sample or descriptor) drops the old key
//     from every set;
//   * a set left with no points is cleared (an empty retained message) rather than published
//     as `{}`, which removes the fragment instead of keeping an empty one.
