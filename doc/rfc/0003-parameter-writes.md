# RFC 0003: Writing to OT devices from the cloud — device parameters

Status: proposed — implemented as a working prototype alongside this RFC (SDK, CLI, flows, operations, e2e and cloud suites)

## Problem

Reading OT points into the cloud is solved (samples → flows → measurements). Writing back is
only half solved: the connector contract has a `write` verb and Cumulocity's legacy
`c8y_SetRegister`/`c8y_SetCoil` operations are shimmed onto it, but

* those operations are Modbus-flavoured, need a per-protocol shim, and have no UI beyond a raw
  operation dialog;
* an operator has no way to *see* the current value of a writable point next to the control
  that changes it;
* nothing tells the cloud *which* points are editable, with which type and limits.

Cumulocity has a generic answer — **device parameters**: Digital Twin Manager (DTM) property
definitions declare a parameter set as a JSON schema, the device reports the set's current
values as a fragment on its managed object (kept fresh through `c8y_ParameterUpdate` events),
and edits in the device's *Parameters* tab arrive as one `c8y_ParameterUpdate` operation per set.
This RFC decides how tedge-dot plugs into that, and settles the four questions the feature
raises.

## Decision in one paragraph

Keep the connector a dumb, cloud-agnostic driver and bridge parameters in flows. The
configuration already says which points are parameters (`access = "read_write"` /
`"write"`, optionally refined by `meta.parameter`); the runtime echoes each point's `access`
in its samples, so a single flow, `ot-parameter-state`, can publish the current values of
every parameter as one retained twin fragment per *parameter set*
(`te/device/<device>///twin/<set>`, keyed by point id) — that fragment is what a cloud UI
displays and edits. The SDK runtime gains one protocol-neutral verb, **`write-batch`**, built on
the module's `write`, so an edit of several parameters is one command with one result; the
existing command flows carry it (`ot-command-forward` reshapes an `parameter_update`
command into a `write-batch`, `ot-command-result` completes it). The Cumulocity glue is one
generic operation template (`c8y_ParameterUpdate` → `parameter_update`). The cloud-side
declaration of the sets (Digital Twin Manager property definitions) is a tenant admin's
one-off act; `tedge-dot describe` prints it from the same TOML so the config remains the single
source of truth, but the device never talks to the DTM service. Writes travel as thin-edge
commands over MQTT, never through the `tedge-dot write` CLI.

## The four questions

### 1. Where does the DTM definition come from?

From the connector configuration, rendered on demand for a tenant admin to register once:

```sh
# One definition per line, and the DTM service takes one per request — a configuration that
# groups its parameters (§5.2) renders several. `</dev/null` matters: without it c8y reads the
# loop's stdin as its own input pipeline and the remaining definitions are never registered.
defs=$(mktemp) one=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$defs" "$one"' EXIT
# every connector config the service runs (/etc/tedge/plugins/ot), a shared set rendered once
tedge-dot describe --compact > "$defs"
# Read from a file, not a pipe: a `while` on the right of a pipe runs in a subshell, where
# `exit 1` would abort only the loop and leave the script reporting success.
while read -r definition; do
    printf '%s' "$definition" > "$one"
    C8Y_SETTINGS_CI=true c8y api POST /service/dtm/definitions/properties --data "@$one" </dev/null ||
        exit 1   # stop at the first rejected definition rather than reporting only the last
done < "$defs"
```

The device does not push the definition: device users do not hold the DTM roles, and
declaring what a fleet may edit is a tenant decision anyway. The Parameters tab only renders
fragments that match a definition, so without this step the values are still visible in the
device's inventory but not editable — an acceptable degraded mode.

A *parameter* is every point whose `access` permits writes, plus points that opt in with
`meta.parameter` (read-only points then render `readOnly: true`, so the tab can *display*
state next to the controls); `meta.parameter = false` opts a writable point out. Parameters are
grouped into *sets*, one set = one DTM identifier = one twin fragment. This RFC's default set
name was `<protocol>_parameters`, which collides across device types;
[RFC 0005](0005-device-types-and-parameter-sets.md) replaced it with
`<device type, else protocol>_<group>_parameters` and is the current rule. Datatype →
JSON-schema type and integer bounds are automatic;
`meta.parameter.{title, description, min, max, enum, default, order}` enrich the schema. The keys of a set are the point ids, unless a point names its own with
`meta.parameter.key` (so `firmwareVersion` can be `version` in a `firmware` set:
`key = "firmware.version"` names the set and the key at once); keys must be plain
identifiers (`[A-Za-z0-9_]`; Cumulocity rejects dots in keys) and unique per set on a device —
`describe` refuses both. The connector's retained capability descriptor lists the keyed points
(`parameter_keys`), so the flows know a key before the point samples: after a mapper restart, and
for a write-only point.

*Later addition:* a point can also be a **literal parameter** with
`meta.parameter = { fragment = "<name>" }`. Its value is then the fragment itself
(`"pump_speed": 42`) and its DTM definition is a primitive `jsonSchema`, not an object with one
property. A Parameters-tab edit carries the bare value (`"pump_speed": 1500`) and becomes a
`write-batch` of one write. See `openspec/specs/literal-parameters/spec.md`.

Three places could own the definition; the config wins:

| Source of the definition | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| **Connector TOML** (this RFC) | Already the single source of truth for points; offline, versionable, deterministic; the same `meta` table that drives flows drives the schema. |
| Cloud Fieldbus device type (RFC 0002) | Only Modbus, and the import already lands in the TOML — so it feeds this path for free rather than replacing it. A device type could later gain a "parameter" flag that the import turns into `meta.parameter`. |
| Hand-written in the DTM UI | Works (the flows only need the identifier to match), but drifts from the config. Kept as the escape hatch. |

### 2. Should the tedge-dot service react to the commands?

To **connector commands** (`te/device/<d>/ot/<protocol>/cmd/<verb>/<id>`): yes, it already
does, and this RFC adds `write-batch` there. To **thin-edge/cloud commands**
(`te/device/<d>///cmd/parameter_update/<id>`, `c8y_ParameterUpdate`): no. The connector
stays ignorant of thin-edge command types and cloud fragments; the bridge is flows, hot-reloaded
and protocol-neutral, exactly like measurements and the existing `ot_write` bridge. Nor does
the runtime publish the twin itself: that would be the driver's first thin-edge-model output
and every runtime (the Rust SDK, the C implementation) would have to replicate the set logic.
What *does* belong in the runtime is what every requester would otherwise re-implement:
writing N points as one ordered request with one result (`write-batch`), and echoing the
point's `access` in samples so a flow can recognise parameters without the TOML file.

### 3. How is the current value of a writable parameter reported, and what about output-only points?

`ot-parameter-state` publishes `te/device/<d>///twin/<set>` on change; the c8y mapper mirrors
it into the managed object, which is exactly what the Parameters tab reads (the
`c8y_ParameterUpdate` *event* path of the device-parameter service is not needed for that and
is left out). Values come from:

* **readable parameters** — every good sample, so the twin follows the device even when a
  value is changed locally on the HMI;
* **read/write parameters** — additionally updated optimistically from an acknowledged write,
  then confirmed by the next sample;
* **write-only parameters** (`access = "write"`) — the last *acknowledged* write. They never
  produce samples, so their set is learned from nothing: they land in the default set (whose
  name the retained link status still qualifies with the device type — RFC 0005) — unless they
  name a key, whose entry in the capability descriptor (`parameter_keys`) names their sets.

Output-only points exist in every protocol (Modbus write-only registers behind FC06/16 on
devices that reject reads of them, OPC UA nodes with `AccessLevel = CurrentWrite`, CANopen
write-only objects). For those the honest answer is: the device cannot tell you the current
state; you only know what you last commanded and that the protocol acknowledged it. The bridge
reports exactly that, the DTM description says so ("write-only: shows the last value written"),
and the value is *absent* (not `null`) until the first successful write after the mapper
started, so the UI never shows an invented state. Persisting the last commanded value across
mapper restarts is a follow-up (a retained `state/<point>` topic owned by the runtime, or the
flow re-reading its own twin, which today's loop protection forbids).

### 4. CLI (`tedge-dot write`) or MQTT commands?

MQTT commands, always, while the service runs. `tedge-dot write` opens a *second* protocol
session to the device: impossible on Modbus RTU (the serial port is exclusive), refused or
disruptive on PLCs that cap Modbus TCP connections or OPC UA sessions, and invisible to the
retained command state machine that flows and the cloud complete against. The CLI stays what
it is — a commissioning and debugging tool for a stopped service. The parameter plugin's
"script per parameter set" model would have pushed writes through the CLI (see below), which
is the main reason not to build on it for point writes.

## tedge-parameter-plugin: owns the Cumulocity operation; the flows serve the OT children

[tedge-parameter-plugin](https://github.com/thin-edge/tedge-parameter-plugin) maps
`c8y_ParameterUpdate` onto a `parameter_update` workflow (tedge-agent) whose `prepare` step
picks the set name out of the operation and whose `run` step executes
`/usr/share/tedge/parameter-plugins/<set> set <json>`; current values are whatever a script
publishes to `te/device/main///twin/<set>`.

Two facts about thin-edge shape the coordination:

1. The c8y mapper binds `.template` files **by fragment name**
   (`get_template_name_by_operation_name` picks the first template whose `on_fragment`
   matches, whatever workflow operation the device declared). Two templates for
   `c8y_ParameterUpdate` can therefore never coexist: a second one silently shadows the first
   for every device. An earlier revision of this prototype shipped its own template and hit
   exactly that.
2. tedge-agent's workflow engine subscribes to commands of **its own entity only**
   (`EntityFilter::Entity(device_topic_id)`), so a `parameter_update` command addressed to a
   child device is never picked up by the plugin's workflow.

Hence the split: the plugin's template is the single owner of the operation, the OT child
devices advertise the plugin's `parameter_update` command (published by `ot-registration`),
the mapper symlinks the plugin's template for them, and `ot-command-forward` /
`ot-command-result` are the only handlers of that command on child devices. On the main device
the plugin's workflow and its script-per-set model keep working untouched — a natural home for
gateway-level settings such as the connector `poll_interval` (a `parameter-plugins/tedge_dot`
script issuing `set-config`; not part of this RFC). No change to the plugin is needed, and the
"dynamic handler" problem does not arise: on children the set name is read from the
`c8y_ParameterUpdate_<set>` marker by the flow.

| | main device (plugin) | OT child devices (this RFC) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operation template | plugin's `c8y_ParameterUpdate.template` | the same file, symlinked per child by the mapper |
| Command type | `parameter_update` | `parameter_update` |
| Handler | tedge-agent workflow → set script | flows → connector `write-batch` |
| Current values | script publishes the twin | `ot-parameter-state` from samples + acknowledged writes |

Why the point writes are not routed through the plugin's scripts instead: a script per set
would push writes through `tedge-dot write` (a second protocol session, see Q4) or hand-rolled
MQTT, and it has no notion of point state; on child devices it cannot run at all.

## Contract additions (additive, SDK-provided)

* `access` in the sample envelope (contract §5): the point's declared access, echoed like
  `meta`. No new topic, no conformance change.
* `write-batch` verb (contract §6.4, `command.schema.json`): ordered, fail-fast, per-point
  `results`; advertised for every module with `write` (the conformance harness treats it as
  implied by `write`). Extra request fields (`origin`, `c8y-mapper`) are ignored by the
  connector and left on the retained `init` for the flows to correlate with.
* `meta.parameter` — the first documented `meta` convention beyond the measurement hints;
  still uninterpreted by the connector (contract §5.2).

## Prototype (this branch)

| Layer | What | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SDK | parameter/set derivation from the config + DTM rendering | `impl/rust/crates/sdk/src/descriptor.rs` |
| SDK runtime | `access` in samples, `write-batch` | `impl/rust/crates/sdk/src/runtime.rs` |
| CLI | `tedge-dot describe [<config-or-dir>...] [--config <config-or-dir>]... [--set] [--device] [--compact]` | `impl/rust/src/main.rs`, `impl/c/src/main.c` |
| Flows | `ot-parameter-state` (new); `ot-command-forward` reshapes `parameter_update`, `ot-command-result` honours `origin.command`; `ot-registration` advertises `parameter_update` | `flows/` |
| c8y glue | none — the tedge-parameter-plugin's template (installed by the cloud e2e image) | |
| Tests | offline flow checks incl. the chain through shared mapper state (`just test-flows`); e2e: `access` in samples, batch semantics, and the flows-driven parameter round-trip on a cloud-free flows runner (`just test-e2e modbus|opcua`); cloud: DTM registration → fragment → operation → measurement (`cloud/modbus/tests/parameters_c8y.robot`) | |

A simplification pass removed an earlier retained point-descriptor topic and two dedicated
parameter flows in favour of the `access` sample field and the existing command flows.

The C implementation ([impl/c/](../../impl/c/)) implements the same runtime pieces
(`access` in samples, `write-batch` with the `executing` transition, and the management verbs
with persist + live reload) and the same parameter derivation and DTM rendering
(`impl/c/sdk/src/descriptor.c`, `tedge-dot describe`), so the flows, the Cumulocity glue and the
tenant admin's registration step work unchanged with either binary. The C build runs the same
Robot e2e suites (`just test-e2e-c`), the same cloud suites (`just test-cloud-c`, which builds
the C connector into the thin-edge demo image) and the same conformance suite
(`just conformance-c`) as the Rust build; `just c-describe-parity` additionally asserts that both binaries render the
same definitions (compared parsed, since key order differs) for every connector config in the
repo.

The e2e stacks gained a `flows` service: thin-edge from the `main` channel running this repo's
flows as a user-defined mapper (`tedge-mapper ot`) against the stack's broker, so the full
device-side chain — registration, command bridge, parameter bridge, twin — is exercised
without a cloud. It needs a thin-edge build with user-defined mappers (2.0.2+ dev), which is
also the reason the demo image (2.0.1) only runs the flows inside the c8y mapper.

## Open items

* Persist last-commanded values of write-only parameters across mapper restarts (see Q3).
* ~~One DTM identifier is tenant-wide: heterogeneous fleets must name sets per device type~~ —
  settled by [RFC 0005](0005-device-types-and-parameter-sets.md): a device declares its `type`
  (or inherits it from its point library) and the set names are derived from it. The Cloud
  Fieldbus import (RFC 0002) can fill that `type` in from the device type it already reads.
* `write-batch` is sequential and non-atomic; a Modbus FC16 fast path for contiguous registers
  is a connector-local optimisation with the same result shape.
* The twin is republished on every value change of a readable parameter (retained, one
  inventory update each). Noisy parameters are better modelled as measurements than as
  parameters.
* Cumulocity's device-parameter service and DTM are opt-in microservices; the twin fragment is
  still published (and inventory-visible) on tenants without them.
* A `c8y_ParameterUpdate` *event* (Cumulocity's audit trail for parameter changes) could be
  added as a tiny flow on top of the twin later; it is not needed for the UI.
