# The Connector SDK and the `Connector` trait

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Draft |
| Crate | `tedge-dot-sdk` |
| Binary | `tedge-dot` |
| Implements | [OT Connector Contract](../contract/ot-connector-contract.md) |

This document specifies the Rust SDK that every protocol module builds on. The goal is that a
new protocol is **only** a `Connector` trait implementation plus a config schema — the SDK
provides everything else (MQTT, scheduling, command routing, health, hot-reload,
serialization, and conformance hooks).

> The [C implementation](../../impl/c/README.md) mirrors this SDK with a vtable of function
> pointers (`tdot_connector_t` in
> [impl/c/sdk/include/tedge_dot/connector.h](../../impl/c/sdk/include/tedge_dot/connector.h)).
> The mapping is one-to-one except for `subscribe`, which the C runtime splits into
> `subscribe_device()` + `drain_subscriptions()` because it has no async runtime to select a
> stream on — see the parity table in the C README.

```

### 1.1 Feature flags

Each protocol module is a separate crate, enabled by a cargo feature on the binary:

```toml
# impl/rust/Cargo.toml (binary)
[features]
default = ["modbus"]
modbus  = ["dep:connector-modbus"]
opcua   = ["dep:connector-opcua"]
bacnet  = ["dep:connector-bacnet"]
canbus  = ["dep:connector-canbus"]
```

A build includes only the protocols it needs (`cargo build --manifest-path impl/rust/Cargo.toml --features modbus,opcua`). The
binary selects the active module at runtime from `connector.protocol` in the config and
fails fast if that protocol was not compiled in.

---

## 2. The `Connector` trait

The trait is intentionally small. A polled protocol implements `read_points`; an
event-driven protocol additionally implements `subscribe`. Everything else is optional or
provided by the SDK.

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;

/// A protocol module. One instance manages the connection(s) for one configured connector.
#[async_trait]
pub trait Connector: Send + Sync {
    /// Validate & parse the protocol-specific parts of the configuration
    /// (connection, device.protocol_address, point.address) into a typed model.
    /// Called once at startup and on every hot-reload. Every device's points are
    /// already fully resolved: a module never sees a `points_from` reference
    /// (contract §3.4), only the points it expanded to.
    fn configure(&mut self, config: &ConnectorConfig) -> Result<(), ConfigError>;

    /// Declare what this connector supports. Drives the capability descriptor and
    /// the conformance suite. Must be cheap and pure.
    fn capabilities(&self) -> Capabilities;

    /// Establish protocol connections to all configured devices.
    /// Per-device success/failure is reported via the returned LinkReport(s).
    async fn connect(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<LinkReport>, ConnectorError>;

    /// Read a batch of points for one device. The SDK calls this on the point/device
    /// schedule. Implementations SHOULD batch contiguous addresses for efficiency.
    /// Returns one Sample per requested point (including `bad`/`stale` samples).
    async fn read_points(
        &mut self,
        device: &DeviceId,
        points: &[PointRef<'_>],
    ) -> Result<Vec<Sample>, ConnectorError>;

    /// OPTIONAL: whether `point` of `device` is delivered by push. Only the points this
    /// answers `true` for are passed to `subscribe` and taken off the polling schedule; the
    /// rest stay polled. Default: every point (a module that pushes some points and polls
    /// others on one device, like SNMP notifications vs. objects, overrides it).
    fn pushes_point(&self, device: &DeviceId, point: &PointRef<'_>) -> bool {
        let _ = (device, point);
        true
    }

    /// OPTIONAL: for event-driven protocols (CAN, OPC-UA subscriptions, BACnet COV).
    /// The implementation pushes Samples into `sink` as values arrive, until cancelled.
    /// The default implementation returns `Unsupported`, which the SDK treats as
    /// "polling only".
    async fn subscribe(
        &mut self,
        device: &DeviceId,
        points: &[PointRef<'_>],
        sink: SampleSink,
    ) -> Result<(), ConnectorError> {
        let _ = (device, points, sink);
        Err(ConnectorError::Unsupported("subscribe"))
    }

    /// OPTIONAL: report whether push delivery for `device` is still live. Asked on every
    /// tick for each device with pushed points; an error is handled like a failed poll
    /// batch (degraded link, reconnect with backoff, re-subscribe). Must be cheap: report
    /// state the module already tracks. The default `Unsupported` leaves liveness to reads.
    async fn check_subscription(&mut self, device: &DeviceId) -> Result<(), ConnectorError> {
        let _ = device;
        Err(ConnectorError::Unsupported("check_subscription"))
    }

    /// OPTIONAL: execute a command verb (default supports nothing).
    /// The SDK routes `cmd/<verb>` requests here after validating the topic/payload.
    /// Implementations MUST honour point `access` and encode `typed` writes per datatype.
    async fn execute(
        &mut self,
        device: &DeviceId,
        verb: &str,
        request: &CommandRequest,
    ) -> Result<CommandResult, ConnectorError> {
        let _ = (device, verb, request);
        Err(ConnectorError::Unsupported(verb.to_string().leak()))
    }

    /// Close connections cleanly. Called on shutdown and before reload.
    async fn disconnect(&mut self) -> Result<(), ConnectorError>;
}
```

### 2.1 Why both `read_points` and `subscribe`

Polled protocols (Modbus) only need `read_points`. Push protocols need `subscribe`. Having
both in the trait from the start means the contract and runtime never have to change when the
first event-driven protocol lands — it just implements the second method. The SDK decides
which to drive based on `capabilities().subscribe` and the point configuration.

---

## 3. Shared model types

These types are SDK-owned so every connector and the conformance suite agree on them. They
serialize to the [sample](../contract/schemas/sample.schema.json) and
[command](../contract/schemas/command.schema.json) schemas.

```rust
pub enum Mode { Raw, Typed }

pub enum DataType {
    Bool,
    Int8, Uint8, Int16, Uint16, Int32, Uint32, Int64, Uint64,
    Float32, Float64,
    StringT, Bytes,
}

pub enum Value {
    Bool(bool),
    Number(f64),
    /// Used for int64/uint64 outside JS safe-integer range, and for string/bytes.
    Text(String),
}

pub enum Quality { Good, Bad, Stale }

pub struct Sample {
    pub ts: OffsetDateTime,
    pub device: DeviceId,
    pub protocol: &'static str,
    pub point: PointId,
    pub mode: Mode,
    pub datatype: Option<DataType>,   // present when typed
    pub value: Option<Value>,         // absent for raw and for bad
    pub raw: Vec<u8>,                 // serialized to space-grouped hex
    pub quality: Quality,
    pub unit: Option<String>,
    pub addr: serde_json::Value,      // protocol-specific echo
    pub seq: Option<u64>,
    pub error: Option<String>,        // required when quality = Bad
}
```

### 3.1 Shared decode helpers (`decode.rs`)

`typed` mode must decode identically across connectors, so primitive decoding lives in the
SDK, not in each module:

```rust
pub fn decode_primitive(
    bytes: &[u8],
    datatype: DataType,
    endianness: Endianness,  // byte order within a word
    word_order: WordOrder,   // order of multi-word reads
) -> Result<Value, DecodeError>;

pub fn encode_primitive(
    value: &Value,
    datatype: DataType,
    endianness: Endianness,
    word_order: WordOrder,
) -> Result<Vec<u8>, DecodeError>;
```

A connector module typically: reads raw words from the wire, then for `typed` points calls
`decode_primitive`. This guarantees the [golden decode vectors](../conformance/conformance-suite.md)
behave the same everywhere. Connectors that need bit-field extraction call a companion
`extract_bitfield` helper and declare the `bitfield` feature.

> The SDK decode helpers are the **only** place IEEE-754 / endianness / word-order logic
> lives. Modules must not re-implement it. This is what makes the contract's promise — "the
> driver only decodes primitives" — uniform and testable.

---

## 4. What the runtime provides for free

The `runtime` module wraps a `Connector` and delivers all contract behaviour so modules stay
tiny:

| Responsibility | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **MQTT** | Connect to the local broker (`rumqttc`), publish/subscribe, retained semantics, reconnection, QoS. |
| **Scheduling** | Drive `read_points` per point/device `poll_interval`; coalesce due points per device into batched calls. |
| **Subscriptions** | For modules advertising `subscribe`, manage the push lifecycle and forward Samples. |
| **Sample publishing** | Serialize `Sample` to the envelope and publish to `sample/<point>` (non-retained). |
| **Command routing** | Subscribe `cmd/<verb>/+`, act only on commands for devices the live configuration defines (contract §6.5: other instances of the protocol receive them too), validate against the command schema, run the state machine (`init→executing→successful|failed`), call `execute`, publish results (retained). Management verbs arrive on the service command topic instead. |
| **Management verbs** | Implement `set-config`/`define-device`/`remove-device` (contract §6.3) generically: patch the config document, validate, persist, and live-reload — so no module writes config-mutation code. Augment `capabilities()` with these verbs + the `management` feature. |
| **Capability descriptor** | Build from `capabilities()` (plus the management verbs above) and publish retained on startup. |
| **Health & link status** | Publish retained service health; turn `LinkReport`s into retained `status/link` messages. |
| **Config & hot-reload** | Load + schema-validate config (contract schema + the module's own schema), watch files with `notify`, call `configure`/`connect` on change without a process restart. |
| **Backpressure / throttling** | Optional per-point minimum publish interval and `bad`-sample rate limiting. |
| **Liveness** | Bound every module call with `connector.operation_timeout` and stamp a `Progress` marker each loop iteration, so the supervisor can restart a wedged connector (`connector.stall_timeout`). See §4.2. |
| **Observability** | Structured logging (`tracing`), and a `--once`/dry-run mode used by the conformance harness. |

A module author therefore writes: a config-parsing step, a capability declaration, connect,
read (and/or subscribe), execute, disconnect. Nothing about MQTT topics, retained flags,
JSON shaping, or the command state machine.

### 4.2 Liveness: bounded calls and the stall watchdog

A module that *hangs* hurts more than one that errors. Every sample, link status and health
message is published from the runtime's single loop, so one protocol call that never returns
takes the whole connector silent — with nothing logged, the retained health still `up`, and only
a service restart to recover. Half-open sockets do exactly this: the peer is gone, nothing is
answered, and no RST ever arrives.

The runtime therefore:

- runs every module call (`connect`, `reconnect`, `read_points`, `subscribe`, `execute`,
  `disconnect`) under `connector.operation_timeout` (default 30s), reporting a breach as a
  transport error so the normal `degraded` + reconnect-with-backoff path handles it;
- stamps a [`Progress`] marker on each loop iteration. The binary races the connector against
  that marker and, if it stops advancing for `connector.stall_timeout` (default 120s), cancels
  and restarts the connector — the loop cannot rescue itself, since the hang is inside it.
  Cancelling drops the MQTT client, so the broker publishes the retained last-will health
  `down` and the outage reaches the cloud. `stall_timeout` must exceed `operation_timeout`; a
  smaller value is raised rather than honoured, and `0` disables the watchdog.

A module **should still bound its own requests** (see the Modbus module's
`connection.request_timeout_s`): failing one request in a second keeps the poll cycle on
schedule, whereas the runtime's bound is a backstop that fails the whole batch. Conformance
check B5 (silent peer) exercises this with a peer that accepts and answers nothing.

Pushed points need one more thing. They are off the polling schedule, so no failing read ever
reveals that the session behind a subscription died — the device just goes quiet behind a
`connected` link. A module that implements `subscribe` should therefore also implement
`check_subscription`, which the runtime asks on every tick for each device with pushed points.
Protocol stacks tend to hide exactly this: async-opcua, for one, re-establishes a dropped session
only a few times and then ends its event loop without telling its caller, and does not notice a
server that stops answering at all.

The bound cancels a module call that outlives it, and cancelling drops the call's future where it
stands. A task the module spawned inside that call is not cancelled with it: a dropped
`JoinHandle` detaches its task. Tie such tasks to a handle that aborts them on drop, or a
reconnect cut short leaves, say, a protocol session running that nothing will ever close.

### 4.1 CLI: direct read/write (no broker)

The binary also exposes `read` and `write` subcommands that drive the **same** `Connector` code
path the runtime uses, but connect straight to a device and act, then exit — no broker or
running service required. This makes it easy to experiment with a config, verify wiring, or script
one-off writes:

```sh
tedge-dot read  -c modbus.toml                                     # every readable point of every device
tedge-dot read  -c modbus.toml -d plc-1 -p boiler_temp -p setpoint
tedge-dot read  -c modbus.toml -d 'plc-*' -p 'boiler_*' --poll     # keep polling at the configured interval
tedge-dot read  -c modbus.toml --interval 500ms --count 10         # override the interval, stop after 10 polls
tedge-dot write -c modbus.toml -d plc-1 -p setpoint --value 21.5   # typed; bool/number/string inferred
tedge-dot write -c modbus.toml -d plc-1 -p status   --raw 00ff     # raw bytes, verbatim
tedge-dot write -c modbus.toml -p 'setpoint_*' --value 0           # one value to every matching writable point
```

Device (`-d`) and point (`-p`) selectors accept `*`/`?` wildcards and default to every device /
every readable point; wildcard patterns skip points whose `access` does not fit the operation,
while explicitly named points are always attempted. `read`/`write` reuse `configure` →
`connect` → `read_points`/`execute(verb="write")` → `disconnect`, and `--json` prints the
contract sample/result envelopes.

The `run` subcommand accepts the same `-c/--config` flag (files or directories; the positional
form still works), `--duration 10s` to stop after a while, and `--output stdout` to print each
sample envelope as one JSON line instead of publishing to MQTT — handy for piping into `jq` or
capturing a trace; the envelope's `device` field identifies the source. The legacy invocation
`tedge-dot [<config>]` still runs the service (an implicit `run` subcommand), so existing
service units are unaffected. Because a direct CLI session opens its own transport, avoid using
it against a serial device while the service is running (the port cannot be shared); Modbus TCP
generally tolerates a second connection.

---

## 5. Module registration

Modules register themselves behind their feature flag so the binary can instantiate the one
named in config:

```rust
// impl/rust/crates/connector-modbus/src/lib.rs
pub fn factory() -> Box<dyn Connector> { Box::new(ModbusConnector::default()) }

// impl/rust/src/main.rs
fn build_connector(protocol: &str) -> Result<Box<dyn Connector>, FatalError> {
    match protocol {
        #[cfg(feature = "modbus")]
        "modbus" => Ok(connector_modbus::factory()),
        #[cfg(feature = "opcua")]
        "opcua"  => Ok(connector_opcua::factory()),
        other => Err(FatalError::ProtocolNotCompiledIn(other.to_string())),
    }
}
```

---

## 6. Minimal module skeleton

The full job of adding a protocol, reduced to its essentials:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct MyConnector { /* parsed config, client handles */ }

#[async_trait]
impl Connector for MyConnector {
    fn configure(&mut self, cfg: &ConnectorConfig) -> Result<(), ConfigError> {
        // parse cfg.connection / device.protocol_address / point.address using serde,
        // validate against my-protocol.schema.json, store typed model.
        Ok(())
    }

    fn capabilities(&self) -> Capabilities {
        Capabilities {
            protocol: "myproto",
            version: env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"),
            modes: vec![Mode::Raw, Mode::Typed],
            datatypes: vec![DataType::Uint16, DataType::Float32],
            point_kinds: vec!["channel".into()],   // protocol-specific kind names
            command_verbs: vec!["write".into()],
            features: vec!["polling".into()],
            subscribe: false,
        }
    }

    async fn connect(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<LinkReport>, ConnectorError> { /* ... */ }

    async fn read_points(&mut self, device: &DeviceId, points: &[PointRef<'_>])
        -> Result<Vec<Sample>, ConnectorError>
    {
        // 1. read raw bytes from the wire (batched)
        // 2. for typed points call sdk::decode::decode_primitive(...)
        // 3. build Sample { quality, value, raw, addr, ... }
        Ok(samples)
    }

    async fn execute(&mut self, device: &DeviceId, verb: &str, req: &CommandRequest)
        -> Result<CommandResult, ConnectorError>
    {
        // verb == "write": check access, encode_primitive for typed, write, return result
    }

    async fn disconnect(&mut self) -> Result<(), ConnectorError> { Ok(()) }
}
```

The reference [Modbus connector spec](../connectors/modbus-connector-spec.md) fills this
skeleton in concretely and is detailed enough to be implemented by an AI agent.

## 7. Dependencies (suggested)

| Concern | Crate |
| --- | --- |
| Async runtime | `tokio` |
| MQTT | `rumqttc` |
| Modbus (reference) | `tokio-modbus` |
| Config / serde | `serde`, `toml`, `serde_json` |
| Schema validation | `jsonschema` |
| File watching | `notify` |
| Time | `time` (RFC 3339, UTC) |
| Logging | `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber` |
| Trait async | `async-trait` |

These are suggestions, not mandates; the contract and trait are what bind a module, not the
specific crates.
