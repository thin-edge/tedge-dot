# `opcua` Connector Spec — sessions, security and certificates

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Implementable |
| Protocol id | `opcua` |
| Crate | `connector-opcua` (feature `opcua`) · C module `impl/c/connectors/opcua/` (option `TDOT_OPCUA`) |
| Builds on | Rust: [`async-opcua`](https://github.com/FreeOpcUa/async-opcua) (MPL-2.0), with `async-opcua-crypto` vendored and patched (`impl/rust/vendor/async-opcua-crypto/TEDGE-DOT-PATCH.md`). C: [open62541](https://github.com/open62541/open62541) 1.5 (MPL-2.0) with [mbedTLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls) 3.6 (Apache-2.0), both built from source and linked statically. [Connector SDK](../sdk/connector-sdk.md) |
| Implements | [OT Connector Contract](../contract/ot-connector-contract.md) v0.1.0 |
| Test vectors | [connectors/opcua/conformance/tools/genpki.py](../../connectors/opcua/conformance/tools/genpki.py) (PKI scenarios, generated at test time) |

This spec is normative for both implementations. Where it says "the connector", the Rust and
the C build behave identically; the tests named in §10 hold them to it.

## 1. Scope

| Operation | Services | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read | Read (`Value` attribute) | polled `read_points` |
| Monitor | CreateSubscription + CreateMonitoredItems (one subscription per device) | `subscribe` |
| Write | Write (`Value` attribute) | `write` (and SDK `write-batch`) |
| Discovery | GetEndpoints (secured devices and non-anonymous identities) | connect |

Security: the `None`, `Basic256Sha256`, `Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep` and `Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss`
policies (and, when explicitly allowed, the deprecated `Basic128Rsa15` and `Basic256`), modes
`none`, `sign`, `sign_and_encrypt`; anonymous, username and X.509 user identities; an
application instance certificate; server certificates trusted by pinning or through a CA chain
with CRLs.

Out of scope: GDS (push/pull certificate management), ECC policies, reverse connect,
cloud-side certificate operations, keys in an HSM/TPM.

## 2. Capability descriptor

```json
{ "protocol": "opcua", "modes": ["raw", "typed"],
  "datatypes": ["bool","int8","uint8","int16","uint16","int32","uint32","int64","uint64","float32","float64","string","bytes"],
  "point_kinds": ["variable"], "command_verbs": ["write", "write-batch"],
  "features": ["polling", "subscribe"], "subscribe": true }
```

`bytes` (ByteString values, §3.7) is advertised by both builds. Security is configuration, not a capability: both builds support all of §3.

## 3. Configuration

Relative paths anywhere in this section (`pki_dir`, `certificate`, `private_key`,
`password_file`, `user_certificate`, `user_private_key`) resolve against the directory of the
configuration file — never against the process working directory.

**Local-only settings** (contract §3.4): a management command (`set-config`, `define-device`)
may not add or change `pki_dir`, `certificate`, `private_key`, `create_certificate`,
`password_file`, `user_certificate`, `user_private_key`, `trust_any_server_certificate`,
`allow_plaintext_password` or `allow_deprecated_security`; such a command fails with
`<place>.<key> may only be set in the configuration file, not by a management command`.
Removing one of them is refused too (removing a whole device is not). An inline `password` is
allowed.

### 3.1 `connection`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application_name` | `"tedge-dot"` | The client's application name (and the CN/O of a generated certificate). |
| `application_uri` | `"urn:tedge-dot"` | The client's application URI. It must be a URI SAN of the application certificate. |
| `connect_timeout_s` | `15` | Bound on discovery and session activation. |
| `request_timeout_s` | `connector.operation_timeout` | Bound on a service call. |
| `security_policy` | `"None"` | Default policy of every device (§3.3). |
| `security_mode` | policy default | Default mode of every device (§3.3). |
| `pki_dir` | `/var/lib/tedge-dot/opcua/pki` | The PKI directory (§4). |
| `certificate`, `private_key` | — | The application certificate (DER or PEM) and key (PEM). Both or neither; when set they are used instead of the PKI directory's `own/` entries and never generated. |
| `create_certificate` | `true` | Generate a certificate when none exists (§4.2). |
| `trust_any_server_certificate` | `false` | Accept any server certificate (§5.4). Devices may override. |
| `allow_deprecated_security` | `false` | Allow `Basic128Rsa15` and `Basic256`. Devices may override. |
| `allow_plaintext_password` | `false` | Allow a password to travel unencrypted (§6.2). Devices may override. |
| `queue_size` | `16` | How many values a monitored item queues between two publishes (§3.8). Devices and points may override. |

A value of the wrong type is a configuration error naming `[connection]` and the key.

### 3.2 `device.protocol_address`

| Key | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | yes | `opc.tcp://host[:port][/path]`. The connector always dials this host and port (§5.1). |
| `security_policy`, `security_mode` | no | Override the `[connection]` defaults (§3.3). |
| `user` | with a password | Username identity. |
| `password` \| `password_file` | no | At most one. A `password_file` is read at configure: its first line, without the line ending. A user without either has an empty password. |
| `user_certificate`, `user_private_key` | together | X.509 user identity (certificate DER or PEM, key PEM). The key must match the certificate and must not be readable by group or others. |
| `trust_any_server_certificate`, `allow_deprecated_security`, `allow_plaintext_password` | no | Per-device overrides of the `[connection]` switches. |
| `queue_size` | no | The device's monitored-item queue size (§3.8); overrides `[connection]`. |

Exactly one identity: anonymous (no identity key), username, or X.509. Mixing them, a password
without `user`, both `password` and `password_file`, or only one of the two certificate keys is
a configuration error.

Secrets are never echoed: not in log output, link status, health, command results, `describe`
output or configuration errors. A password that is not a string is reported without its value.

### 3.3 Policy and mode

Policy names are the URI fragments (`Basic256Sha256`, `Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep`,
`Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss`, …); the full `http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#…` URI is
accepted too. Modes: `none`, `sign`, `sign_and_encrypt` (`signandencrypt` is accepted as an
alias).

- The device's `security_policy` wins over the connection's. A device that sets its own
  policy but no mode gets that policy's default mode — it does **not** inherit the
  connection's mode. Otherwise the device's mode wins over the connection's.
- A policy's default mode is `none` for `None` and `sign_and_encrypt` for every other policy.
- `None` requires `none`; every other policy requires `sign` or `sign_and_encrypt`.
- Deprecated policies need `allow_deprecated_security = true`.

Violations are configuration errors naming the device and the field: `device 'plc':
security_mode 'none' cannot be used with security_policy 'Basic256Sha256' …`.

### 3.4 `point.address`

`{ node_id = "ns=2;s=Temperature" }` or `{ namespace = 2, identifier = "Temperature" | 1001 }`.

Two optional keys select one value out of a structured or array value (§3.7):

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `field` | A dotted path into a structure: `"Speed"`, `"Motor.Current"`, `"Items[1].Value"`. A segment may carry one zero-based element index `[n]`. |
| `index` | One zero-based element of an array variable, selected on the server through `IndexRange`. May be combined with `field` when the elements are structures. |

One more optional key applies to subscribed points:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `queue_size` | The point's monitored-item queue size (§3.8); overrides the device's. |

Points with either key are read-only (`access = "write"` or `"read_write"` is a configuration
error). `field` needs `mode = "typed"`: a raw point reads the whole structure body.

### 3.5 Reporting policy (`report`)

The SDK runtime applies the point's `report` table ([contract §5.3](../contract/ot-connector-contract.md#53-reporting-policy-report-by-exception)) to polled and
subscribed nodes alike, before a sample is published. See [Reducing data volume](../reducing-data-volume.md).

Both kinds of point support a heartbeat (`max_interval`). A polled node publishes its next
poll. A subscribed node (monitored item) only notifies on a change, so a static node would
otherwise go silent after its first value; once `max_interval` has passed without a publish,
the runtime **reads the node on demand** through the ordinary read path, bounded by
`operation_timeout`. A failed or timed-out read publishes a `bad` sample and affects the link
status like a failed poll. The packaged config sets `[connector] report = { max_interval = "30m" }`,
which keeps a device whose subscribed values never change available in Cumulocity.

### 3.6 Value mapping (`map`)

The SDK runtime applies the point's `map` ([contract §4.3](../contract/ot-connector-contract.md#43-value-mapping)) to polled and subscribed nodes
alike, after the transform, and maps a written value back before the connector writes the node.
Two cases are common. An enumeration node (an `Int32` state) can be mapped to labels, and a
`String` node holding a number can become a number with `map = { as = "number" }`. See
[Mapping values](../mapping-values.md).

### 3.7 Structured values, array elements and other built-in types (Rust build)

An OPC UA structure (a custom data type) arrives as an ExtensionObject: an encoding id and a
binary body that has no meaning without the type's layout. The connector compiles no type in. It
reads the layout from the server instead: once per session, for each node with `field` points,
it reads the variable's `DataType` and that type's `DataTypeDefinition` attribute (OPC UA 1.04),
along with the definitions of nested structures. A variable declared with the abstract
`Structure` (or `BaseDataType`) is resolved through its value: the encoding id of the structure it
holds leads to the concrete DataType by the `HasEncoding` reference. Only the types a point needs
are read. They are read again after every reconnect, so a server update is picked up.

**Datapoint mode.** Browse the server (for example with UaExpert), find the variable, and add
one point per field you want:

```toml
[[device.point]]
id       = "pump1_speed"
datatype = "float64"
address  = { node_id = "ns=2;s=Pump1.Status", field = "Speed" }

[[device.point]]
id       = "pump1_motor_current"
datatype = "float32"
address  = { node_id = "ns=2;s=Pump1.Status", field = "Motor.Current" }
```

Each field is published as an ordinary typed sample, so `transform`, `map`, `report`, `meta`
and every flow work as for any other point. Fields that share a node are served by one Read
per poll cycle and one monitored item.

- Selectable field types: Boolean, the integers, Float, Double, String, Enumerations (as
  `int32`), and the built-in types below. The declared `datatype` is checked when the definition
  is read; a mismatch gives bad samples such as `field "Speed" is Double, point declares int32
  (accepted: float64)`.
- Structures, StructureWithOptionalFields and Unions are supported. An absent optional field or
  an inactive union member gives a bad sample that says so.
- Every other built-in type, arrays and nested structures before the selected field are skipped
  by their encoded length.
- Not supported: StructureWithSubtypedValues, multi-dimensional fields, XML or JSON encoded
  bodies. Such a definition, or a server without `DataTypeDefinition` (OPC UA 1.03), gives bad
  samples starting `data type definition unavailable`. The device link is not degraded.

**Raw mode.** A `mode = "raw"` point on a structure publishes the encoded body as `raw`, with
`addr.data_type` and `addr.encoding_id` in namespace-URI form (`nsu=urn:…;i=3000`), so a flow
can decode types the connector cannot, such as those of a 1.03 server.

**Array elements.** `index = n` selects one element of an array variable, `field = "A[n]"` one
of an array field. An index beyond the current length gives bad samples naming the index; the
point recovers when the array grows. A server that ignores `IndexRange` and returns the whole
array (python-asyncua does) is handled: the connector selects the element itself.

**Other built-in types.** Values of these types are read as top-level variables, fields and
array elements; the declared `datatype` chooses the rendering:

| OPC UA type | `datatype` | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DateTime | `string` / `int64` | `2026-10-06T08:15:30.25Z` / `1791274530250` (Unix ms) |
| LocalizedText | `string` | `Betrieb` (the text; the locale is dropped) |
| StatusCode | `uint32` / `string` | `2150891520` / `BadNodeIdUnknown` |
| Guid | `string` | `72962b91-fa75-4ae6-8d28-b404dc7daf63` |
| NodeId, ExpandedNodeId | `string` | `nsu=urn:acme:types;i=1001` |
| QualifiedName | `string` | `2:Speed` |
| ByteString | `bytes` | `deadbeef` (hex) |

Writes are limited to the primitive types and String. The exact rendering rules and messages
are pinned by the vectors in `doc/contract/test-vectors/opcua-struct/`. The C build does not
implement this section yet (capability `opcua-structures`, see `impl/c/README.md`), except for a
top-level ByteString variable: it is read as `bytes` in both builds, and the C build refuses a value
longer than 127 bytes with a bad sample (its fixed value buffer) instead of truncating it.

### 3.8 Subscription timing (`sampling_interval`)

A subscribed node is not sent the moment it changes. The server runs two timers:

- **Sampling**, per monitored item: how often the server checks the node's value. The
  connector requests the point's effective `sampling_interval`
  ([contract §3.1](../contract/ot-connector-contract.md#31-common-protocol-neutral-point-fields)):
  the point's, else its device's, else `[connector]`'s, else the point's effective
  `poll_interval`. Each item queues up to the point's effective `queue_size` values between
  two publishes, with `discardOldest = true` (see "Queue size" below).
- **Publishing**, per subscription (one per device): how often the server sends the queued
  changes. It is not configurable. The connector requests the fastest effective sampling
  interval among the device's subscribed points.

A change therefore arrives up to about **one sampling interval plus one publishing interval**
after it happens. With the default `poll_interval = "2s"` and no `sampling_interval`, that is
about 4 s. To get changes faster without polling the other points faster:

```toml
[[device]]
name              = "opc-server-1"
protocol_address  = { endpoint = "opc.tcp://plc:4840/" }
poll_interval     = "10s"     # polled nodes (subscribe = false)
sampling_interval = "200ms"   # subscribed nodes: sampled and published about every 200 ms
```

`sampling_interval = "0"` asks the server for its fastest rate. The server decides what that
means; it can be far more traffic, and more load on whatever the server reads the value from.
One point at `"0"` also makes the whole device's subscription publish at the server's fastest
rate. Use it only when you need it.

**Queue size.** A node that changes more often than the publishing interval produces several
values per publish. The monitored item keeps up to `queue_size` of them and drops the oldest
beyond that, so every change arrives as its own sample as long as no more than `queue_size`
happen between two publishes. The effective queue size is the point's `address.queue_size`,
else the device's `protocol_address.queue_size`, else `[connection] queue_size`, else **16**. It
must be an integer from 1 to 65535. Anything else is refused with `<place>: queue_size must be an
integer from 1 to 65535`, the same in both builds.

`queue_size = 1` sends only the latest value per publish. That was the fixed behaviour before
the queue size could be set: **the default changed from 1 to 16**. Set `[connection]
queue_size = 1` to keep the previous behaviour. To publish fewer readings, prefer
`report.min_interval` or a deadband (§3.5), which act per point after the values have arrived.

The server may revise the queue size (python-asyncua grants what is asked; an async-opcua server caps it
at 10). When it does, both builds log an `info` line naming the device, the point, the requested
and the revised size, and keep what was granted.

**Shared nodes.** The Rust build creates one monitored item for all points on the same node and
array element, with the fastest sampling interval and the largest queue size among them. The C
build creates one item per point, with that point's own values.

**Many points.** Both builds create a device's monitored items in requests of at most 500, so a
device with thousands of subscribed points subscribes. The Rust client also decodes arrays of up
to 65535 elements, where async-opcua's default limit of 1000 used to refuse such a device with
`BadDecodingError`. A refused item has a different effect in each build:

- Rust: any refused item, or any failed request, deletes the device's subscription, and all of
  its points are polled.
- C: only the refused points are polled. The subscription is dropped only when the server
  accepted no item at all.

The C build buffers pushed values between two runtime ticks in a queue per device. The queue
starts with room for twice the device's subscribed points, so every point's initial value
fits. It doubles when a burst fills it, up to 65536 entries or four times the points, whichever
is larger. Past that it drops the newest value and logs a `warn` line naming the device and the
bound.

The server may grant other rates than requested. When the revised sampling interval of an item,
or the revised publishing interval of a subscription, differs from the requested one, both
builds log an `info` line naming the device (and the point), the requested and the revised
value. The connector keeps what the server granted.

The publishing interval also paces the subscription keep-alive that the connector's
`check_subscription` ([SDK](../sdk/connector-sdk.md)) relies on to notice a dead session: it
allows about `publishing interval × 20 + publishing interval` without a publish. That is one
reason the publishing interval is not used as a rate limit. To limit how often a point is
published, use `report.min_interval` (§3.5): it is per point and does not delay the first change
after a quiet spell.

## 4. The PKI directory

### 4.1 Layout

```
<pki_dir>/
  own/certs/cert.der    application instance certificate
  own/private/key.pem   its private key (directory 0700, file 0600)
  trusted/certs/        trusted server certificates (pinned) and trusted CA certificates
  trusted/crl/          CRLs of the CAs in trusted/certs
  issuers/certs/        intermediate CAs: complete a chain, never trusted on their own
  issuers/crl/          CRLs of the CAs in issuers/certs
  rejected/certs/       server certificates that failed validation
```

- Files are recognised by content — a DER certificate or CRL, or PEM text with any number of
  `CERTIFICATE` / `X509 CRL` blocks — never by name or extension. A file that does not parse is
  skipped with a warning naming it; the other files still count.
- Files the connector or `tedge-dot pki` writes are named `<CN>_<thumbprint>.der` (the common
  name with every character but ASCII letters, digits, `-` and `.` replaced by `_`; the SHA-1
  thumbprint in lower-case hex) and CRLs `<thumbprint of the CRL>.crl`. Writes go through a
  temporary file and `rename(2)`.
- The trust lists are read again on every connect attempt: a change takes effect on the
  device's next (re)connect, without a reload.
- A configuration whose devices all use `None` neither creates nor reads the directory.

### 4.2 Application instance certificate

When at least one device is secured, the connector loads the certificate at configure time:
the configured `certificate`/`private_key`, else `own/`, else — when neither file exists and
`create_certificate` is true — a new one. Generation runs under an exclusive `flock` on
`own/.lock`, so connectors sharing a directory generate one certificate between them.

A generated certificate is self-signed, RSA 2048 bits, SHA-256, with a random serial,
valid for 5 years, with key usage digitalSignature/nonRepudiation/keyEncipherment/
dataEncipherment/keyCertSign, extended key usage serverAuth/clientAuth, and the subject
alternative names `application_uri` (first) followed by the machine's host name.

The certificate is refused when its key does not match, when the key file is readable by group
or others, or when `application_uri` is not one of its SANs. A certificate that cannot be
obtained is **not** a configuration error: unsecured devices work, and each secured device
stays `disconnected` with the reason `application certificate: …`. The same applies while the
certificate is expired. The connector warns at configure time and then at most once a day while
the certificate expires within 30 days. A renewed certificate is picked up on reload or restart.

## 5. Connecting

### 5.1 Endpoint selection

An anonymous device without security dials `endpoint` directly. Every other device first
calls GetEndpoints on `endpoint` (over a channel without security, which servers allow for
discovery) and selects the endpoint with the device's policy and mode that offers a user token
policy for its identity, preferring the highest `securityLevel`. The selected endpoint's URL is
replaced *in full* by the configured `endpoint` — host, port and resource path: the session
always goes to the configured address (servers behind NAT advertise names the client cannot
reach, and the UA-.NETStandard reference server advertises `opc.tcp://0.0.0.0:<port>`, which
nothing can dial), and host-name checks use the configured host.

No endpoint with the policy and mode → `no matching endpoint: the server offers no <policy>/<mode>
endpoint (it offers <policy>/<mode>, …)` (sorted, deduplicated). A policy this connector does
not implement is listed by its full URI rather than dropped, so a server offering only, say,
the ECC policies explains itself instead of appearing to offer nothing. Such endpoints exist, but none
accepts the identity → `identity unsupported: …`. The token policy must be listed, for an
anonymous identity too: an endpoint that lists no token policies is not usable, since neither
client library can activate a session on it.

### 5.2 Server certificate validation

Before dialling a secured endpoint, the connector validates the certificate the endpoint
advertises; the session validates the certificate of the channel again the same way. Steps, in
order:

0. **Key length** for the policy is checked first, before any trust lookup: 2048–4096 bits
   (1024–2048 for the deprecated policies). A key that is too short cannot be made acceptable by
   trusting the certificate, so reporting it as untrusted — and advising `tedge-dot pki trust` —
   would send the operator in a circle. Such a certificate is refused as `certificate invalid:`
   naming the key size and the policy, and is *not* copied to `rejected/certs`, which is a list
   of certificates an operator could choose to trust. (The UA-.NETStandard reference server
   auto-generates a 1024-bit certificate, so this is not hypothetical.)
1. **Pinned.** A certificate identical to one in `trusted/certs` is trusted.
2. **Chain.** Otherwise the path is built from the certificate through CAs (basicConstraints
   `cA`, subject = issuer, valid signature: RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 with SHA-1/256/384/512 or RSA-PSS
   with SHA-256/384/512) taken from `trusted/certs` then `issuers/certs`, until a CA from
   `trusted/certs` is reached. No path, a path longer than 8, or a self-issued CA that is only
   in `issuers/` → untrusted.
3. **Revocation.** For every certificate on the path, the CRLs issued (named and signed) by its
   issuer are looked up in both `crl` directories. None → revocation unknown. Its serial listed
   → revoked. A CA outside its validity period → issuer time invalid.
4. **Validity period** of the certificate.
5. **Host name**: one of the certificate's SANs after the first equals the configured host
   (case-insensitive).
6. **Application URI**: the first SAN equals the server's advertised `applicationUri`.

An untrusted certificate (steps 1–2) is copied to `rejected/certs` unless it is already there.
`rejected/certs` is a list for the operator to review (OPC UA Part 12), not a deny list: a
certificate that is pinned or chains to a trusted CA is trusted even when a copy is still there,
as happens when a server was first seen before its CA was trusted. To stop trusting a single
certificate that a trusted CA issued, revoke it in that CA's CRL.

A server may advertise its certificate chain (leaf first, then its CAs). Both builds validate
the first certificate; the CAs it sends are not used, so intermediates belong in
`issuers/certs`.

### 5.3 Reasons (link status)

A security failure leaves the device `disconnected` with a `reason` starting with one of:

| Prefix | Status codes / cause |
| --- | --- |
| `certificate untrusted:` | BadCertificateUntrusted, BadSecurityChecksFailed while validating the server certificate; includes the thumbprint, the subject and ``trust it with `tedge-dot pki trust <8 hex>` ``. |
| `application certificate rejected:` | The same status codes, but *after* §5.2 passed (or was skipped by §5.4): the refusal is then the server's judgement of **our** certificate, not ours of theirs. Names our own thumbprint and says to hand `tedge-dot pki export` to the server administrator. Only the ordering tells the two apart — the wire says the same thing both ways. |
| `certificate invalid:` | BadCertificateTimeInvalid, BadCertificateIssuerTimeInvalid, BadCertificateHostNameInvalid, BadCertificateUriInvalid, BadCertificateInvalid, BadCertificatePolicyCheckFailed, BadCertificateUseNotAllowed, BadCertificateIssuerUseNotAllowed, BadCertificateChainIncomplete |
| `certificate revoked:` | BadCertificateRevoked, BadCertificateIssuerRevoked, BadCertificate[Issuer]RevocationUnknown (the text says "revocation unknown" and to add the CRL, an empty one if the CA revoked nothing) |
| `no matching endpoint:` | §5.1 |
| `identity rejected:` | BadIdentityTokenRejected, BadIdentityTokenInvalid, BadUserAccessDenied |
| `identity unsupported:` | §5.1 |
| `plaintext password refused:` | §6.2 |
| `application certificate:` | §4.2 |

Consumers match the prefix only; the text after it is for people. The link status is published
when the status changes, so the reason shown is that of the failure that made the device
`disconnected`.

### 5.4 `trust_any_server_certificate`

Skips §5.2 entirely (messages are still signed/encrypted as configured) and writes nothing to
the PKI directory. The connector logs a warning on every connect.

## 6. Identity

### 6.1 Tokens

The token uses the selected endpoint's user token policy. A username token is encrypted as the
policy (or, when it names none, the channel's policy) requires; an X.509 token is signed with
the user key using the policy's algorithm.

### 6.2 Plaintext passwords

A password is unprotected, and refused — `plaintext password refused: …` — unless
`allow_plaintext_password` is true (then a warning is logged on every connect), when:

- the channel has no message security (`none`), whatever the username token policy says. OPC UA
  Part 4 Table 193 lets such a token be encrypted, but to a server certificate that nothing on
  a `none` channel authenticates (neither client library validates it there), so any server
  the device is pointed at could decrypt it;
- the channel is signed only (`sign`) and the token policy explicitly names `None`: the password
  is then in clear on the wire.

On `sign_and_encrypt`, or with a token policy that names a real policy on `sign`, the server
certificate was validated (§5.2) and the password is protected.

## 7. Status

Link status `info` (contract §8):

```json
{ "endpoint": "opc.tcp://plc:4840/", "security_policy": "Basic256Sha256",
  "security_mode": "sign_and_encrypt", "server_certificate": "trusted",
  "server_thumbprint": "a1b2…" }
```

`server_certificate` (`"trusted"` or `"not_verified"`) and `server_thumbprint` are present once
known for a secured device. The object never holds a credential.

## 8. `tedge-dot pki`

`tedge-dot pki <action> [--pki-dir <dir>] [-c|--config <file>] [--json]` works offline (no
broker, no server). The PKI directory is `--pki-dir`, else the `pki_dir` of `--config`, else of
`/etc/tedge/plugins/ot/opcua.toml` when it exists, else the default. The connection settings
(`application_name`, `application_uri`, `certificate`, `private_key`) come from the same file.
Exit status: 0 success, 1 usage or input error, 2 the named certificate does not exist.

| Action | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `show` | The application certificate: paths, subject, issuer, thumbprint, validity, application URI, host names, whether the URI matches `application_uri`. |
| `export [--pem] [-o FILE]` | Write the certificate (DER by default), never the key. |
| `create [--application-uri URI] [--hostname NAME]... [--days N] [--force]` | Generate the certificate in `own/` (§4.2). An existing one is refused unless `--force`, which keeps it as `cert.der.<unix time>` / `key.pem.<unix time>`. |
| `list [trusted\|issuers\|rejected]` | Certificates with group, thumbprint, subject, expiry, whether a CA and (for a CA) whether its CRL is present. |
| `trust <thumbprint\|file>` | Move a rejected certificate to `trusted/`, or import every certificate of a file there (and out of `rejected/`). |
| `reject <thumbprint>` | Move a trusted certificate to `rejected/`. Warns when the certificate is still trusted through a CA (revoke it instead). |
| `remove <thumbprint> [--group G]` | Delete a certificate. |
| `add-issuer <file>` | Import CA certificates into `issuers/` (non-CA certificates are refused). |
| `add-crl <file>` | Store each CRL next to the CA (trusted or issuers) that issued it; a CRL of an unknown CA is refused. |

A thumbprint is matched case-insensitively and may be a prefix of at least 8 hex digits; a
prefix matching several certificates is an error listing them. Run as root on a PKI directory
another user owns (the packaged one belongs to `tedge`), the command works as that user
(effective user and group): what it writes belongs to the owner, and a symlink placed in the
directory cannot redirect a write to a file only root may change. The file an action reads
and the `export --output` file are accessed as root.

JSON field names (both builds; keys unordered):

- `show`/`create`: `certificate`, `private_key`, `subject`, `issuer`, `thumbprint`,
  `not_before`, `not_after`, `application_uri` (or `null`), `hostnames`,
  `configured_application_uri`, `uri_matches`, and for `create` `created`.
- `list`: `pki_dir`, `certificates[]` of `{group, thumbprint, subject, not_after, ca, crl, file}`
  (`crl` is `null` for a non-CA).
- `trust`/`reject`/`remove`/`add-issuer`: `action`, `certificates[]` (as above).
- `add-crl`: `action`, `crls[]` of `{file}`.
- `export`: `thumbprint`, `format`, and `file` (with `--output`) or `pem`.

Subjects print as `CN=…, O=…` in encoding order; times as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.

## 9. Packaging

The packages create `/var/lib/tedge-dot/opcua/pki` (owner `tedge`, mode 0750) with
`own/private` (0700), generate nothing, and leave the contents alone on upgrade and removal. A
Debian purge deletes the directory.

## 10. Tests

| Layer | Where |
| --- | --- |
| PKI vectors (both builds, same scenarios) | `connector-opcua/tests/pki.rs`, `impl/c/tests/opcua_pki.c` over `genpki.py` |
| Configuration rules | `connector-opcua/src/config.rs`, `impl/c/tests/config.c`; secrets property test `connector-opcua/tests/secrets.rs` |
| Secured sessions (in-process server) | `connector-opcua/tests/security.rs` |
| Conformance over secured channels | `connectors/opcua/conformance-secure.toml`, `conformance-secure-c.toml` |
| End to end | `connectors/opcua/tests/opcua_security_e2e.robot` (`docker-compose.secure.yaml`) |
| Interop, third-party server | `connectors/opcua/interop/tests/opcua_interop.robot` (`just test-interop opcua`, and `-c`) |
| `tedge-dot pki` | `impl/rust/tests/pki_cli.rs`, `impl/c/tests/opcua_pki_cli.sh`, parity `impl/c/ci/pki-parity.sh` |
| Fuzzing | `connector-opcua/fuzz` (`pki_files`) |

Every layer above the interop one runs against a server this project wrote, so a misreading of
the specification is invisible to it. The interop suite exists to catch that: it runs both
implementations against the OPC Foundation UA-.NETStandard reference stack (packaged by
`php-opcua/uanetstandard-test-suite`, MIT). It is a separate CI job from `e2e`, so an upstream
regression cannot fail the suites that gate our own behaviour, and it is the only place where
`Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep`, `Basic256` and `Basic128Rsa15` are exercised on the wire.
