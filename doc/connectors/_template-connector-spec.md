# `<protocol>` Connector Spec — Template

> Copy this file to `connectors/<protocol>-connector-spec.md` and fill in every section.
> A spec is "done" when an implementer (human or AI agent) can build the connector from it
> plus the [SDK spec](../sdk/connector-sdk.md) and pass the
> [conformance suite](../conformance/conformance-suite.md). Keep prose minimal and tables
> precise. Anything you leave vague will be implemented inconsistently.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Draft / Implementable |
| Protocol id | `<protocol>` |
| Crate | `connector-<protocol>` (feature `<protocol>`) |
| Builds on | `<rust crate(s) used>`, [Connector SDK](../sdk/connector-sdk.md) |
| Implements | [OT Connector Contract](../contract/ot-connector-contract.md) v0.1.0 |

## 1. Scope

State what this connector reads/writes and explicitly that scaling/naming/alarms/shaping are
flow responsibilities. List the protocol operations supported and the underlying crate calls.

| Object kind | Read | Write | Library call |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<kind>` | yes/no | yes/no | `<call>` |

## 2. Capability descriptor

Provide the exact JSON the connector publishes (contract §7). Set `subscribe` correctly: is
this protocol polled, push, or both?

```json
{
  "protocol": "<protocol>",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "modes": ["raw", "typed"],
  "datatypes": ["..."],
  "point_kinds": ["..."],
  "command_verbs": ["write"],
  "features": ["polling"],
  "subscribe": false
}
```

## 3. Protocol-specific configuration

Define the shape of the three opaque contract slots and provide a JSON Schema
(`<protocol>.schema.json`).

### 3.1 `connection`
### 3.2 `device.protocol_address`
### 3.3 `point.address`

For each, give a table of fields (name, required, notes) and a TOML example.

## 4. Decoding rules (typed mode)

Specify how raw bytes map to the contract datatypes via the SDK `decode_primitive` helper:

- What is the smallest addressable unit and its native endianness?
- How do `endianness` and `word_order` apply (or not)?
- Datatype → read-size table.
- Any allowed refinement (e.g. bit-fields), declared as a `feature`.

## 5. Read flow

Describe `read_points` (polled) and/or `subscribe` (push): batching strategy, error → `bad`
sample behaviour, what goes in `addr`.

## 6. Write flow

Describe `execute` for verb `write` (and any extra verbs you declare): typed vs raw encoding,
access checks, read-modify-write if needed.

## 7. Status

Describe link-status semantics for this protocol (what counts as connected/degraded).

## 8. Acceptance test vectors

Provide normative vectors: input bytes/frames → expected `Sample`. Cover every advertised
datatype, both word orders if applicable, a bad read, and a write round-trip. These feed the
conformance suite.

## 9. Implementation checklist

A numbered list an agent can follow end-to-end.

## 10. Testing & simulation directory layout

Every connector ships with a complete, self-contained e2e harness under
`connectors/<protocol>/`. When you fill in this spec, also create these files:

```
connectors/<protocol>/
  sim/                          # simulator image
    Dockerfile                  # builds the simulator container
    <server-code>               # e.g. server.py or a pre-built binary
  tests/
    <protocol>_e2e.robot        # Robot Framework suite (see §11)
  packaging/
    <protocol>.toml             # default installed config (no devices, correct service_name)
  docker-compose.yaml           # 3 services: broker, simulator, connector
  Dockerfile.connector          # builds the Rust connector binary from project root
  connector.toml                # connector config baked into the container
  entrypoint.sh                 # waits for deps, then execs tedge-dot
  requirements.txt              # protocol-specific Python deps (omit if none needed)
```

Shared across all connectors (do **not** duplicate these):

```
connectors/_shared/
  MqttClient.py                 # Robot keyword library — import via ../../_shared/MqttClient.py
  mosquitto.conf                # identical broker config for every stack
  requirements.txt              # base deps: robotframework, paho-mqtt
```

### Broker port assignment

Pick the next unused host port from the table in
[connectors/README.md](../../connectors/README.md) and add a row for your protocol.
Port clashes make simultaneous multi-protocol runs fail silently.

---

## 11. Justfile integration

The `just` recipes in the project root are **protocol-neutral**. They derive
the Docker compose file path, venv location, and test directory from the
protocol name you pass:

```sh
just sim <protocol>            # start only the simulator
just sim-down <protocol>       # stop it
just e2e-up <protocol>         # bring the full stack up
just e2e-down <protocol>       # tear it down
just test-e2e <protocol>       # up → robot → down (CI entry-point)
```

**No justfile changes are required** when adding a new protocol. The only
preconditions are:

1. `connectors/<protocol>/docker-compose.yaml` exists and defines `broker`,
   `simulator`, and `connector` services.
2. `connectors/<protocol>/tests/` contains at least one `.robot` file.
3. The broker uses a unique host port (see §10).

`test-e2e` installs `connectors/_shared/requirements.txt` first, then
`connectors/<protocol>/requirements.txt` if present (use this for
protocol-specific Python deps such as `asyncua`).

## 12. New protocol checklist

Use this list to track progress when implementing a new connector. Cross-reference
each item with the corresponding section of this spec.

- [ ] **Rust crate** — `impl/rust/crates/connector-<protocol>/` created, `Connector`
  trait implemented (§5, §6, §7), feature flag added in `impl/rust/Cargo.toml`.
- [ ] **Spec** — this template filled out and saved as
  `doc/connectors/<protocol>-connector-spec.md`.
- [ ] **Simulator** — `connectors/<protocol>/sim/` created with a working
  `Dockerfile` (§10).
- [ ] **Docker stack** — `docker-compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile.connector`,
  `connector.toml`, `entrypoint.sh` created with correct paths and a
  unique broker port (§10, §11).
- [ ] **Tests** — `connectors/<protocol>/tests/<protocol>_e2e.robot` covers
  capabilities descriptor, health, link status, at least one typed read, a bad
  read, and a write round-trip (§8).
- [ ] **Packaging config** — `packaging/config/<protocol>.toml` created with
  `protocol`, `service_name`, and sensible defaults, and listed in
  `.goreleaser.yaml` (§10).
- [ ] **`just test-e2e <protocol>`** passes locally.
- [ ] **Port table** in `connectors/README.md` updated.

# Capability sketches for upcoming protocols

These are **not** full specs — they are starting notes to show the contract generalizes and to
seed future spec PRs. Each will graduate to its own file using the template above.

## CAN bus (`canbus`)

| Aspect | Sketch |
| --- | --- |
| Library | `socketcan` (Linux SocketCAN) |
| Nature | **Push** (frames arrive asynchronously) → implements `subscribe`, `subscribe: true`. |
| Device | A CAN interface, e.g. `{ interface = "can0", bitrate = 500000 }`. |
| Point | A signal within a frame: `{ can_id = "0x1A0", start_bit, bit_count, byte_order, value_type }` (DBC-like). |
| Typed | Decode a signal as int/uint/float from a bit range of an 8-byte frame; `endianness` ≈ Intel/Motorola byte order. |
| Raw | Emit the full 8-byte frame payload as hex. |
| Write | `write` verb sends a CAN frame (for points whose `access` allows). |
| Notes | A flow can apply the DBC scale/offset; the connector only extracts the bit-field. Subscription model fits the SDK `subscribe` path directly. |

## BACnet/IP (`bacnet`)

| Aspect | Sketch |
| --- | --- |
| Library | a Rust BACnet stack (e.g. `bacnet-rs`) or FFI to a C stack |
| Nature | Polled (ReadProperty) **and** push (COV subscription) → `subscribe: true`, `features: ["polling","cov"]`. |
| Device | `{ device_instance = 1234, address = "192.168.0.50:47808" }`. |
| Point | An object property: `{ object_type = "analog-input", instance = 3, property = "present-value" }`. |
| Typed | BACnet already carries typed values (Real, Unsigned, Boolean, Enumerated); map to contract datatypes; `endianness`/`word_order` largely N/A. |
| Raw | Emit the encoded APDU value as hex for unusual types. |
| Write | `write` verb → WriteProperty (respecting priority array could be a future verb extension). |
| Notes | Because BACnet is self-describing, `typed` decode is mostly a type map; the flow still does engineering-unit naming and thresholds. |

## OPC-UA (`opcua`)

> Implemented: see [opcua-connector-spec.md](opcua-connector-spec.md) for the normative spec
> (security, certificates, `tedge-dot pki`). The sketch below is the original outline.

| Aspect | Sketch |
| --- | --- |
| Library | `opcua` crate (client) |
| Nature | Polled (Read) **and** push (MonitoredItems/Subscriptions) → `subscribe: true`. |
| Device | An OPC-UA server endpoint + security: `{ endpoint = "opc.tcp://host:4840", security_policy, auth }`. |
| Point | A node: `{ node_id = "ns=2;s=Boiler.Temp" }`. |
| Typed | OPC-UA `Variant` is already typed (Double, Int32, Boolean, String…); map to contract datatypes; carry the source timestamp into `ts`; map StatusCode → `quality`. |
| Raw | Emit the encoded variant bytes as hex when the type is exotic. |
| Write | `write` verb → Write service call. |
| Notes | OPC-UA's StatusCode maps cleanly to the contract's `good`/`bad`/`stale` quality. Subscriptions are the natural mode; polling is a fallback. The flow handles renaming and any unit conversion. |

These four sketches share one config model, one sample envelope, one command protocol, and one
conformance harness — which is the entire point of the contract.
