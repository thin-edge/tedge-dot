# With no arguments every connector config in the repo is checked (the demo

# Key ORDER is allowed to differ — serde_json sorts object keys, cJSON keeps
# insertion order — so the documents are compared parsed, not as text. Numbers
# compare by value (0.0 == 0), which is what both JSON readers and the DTM
