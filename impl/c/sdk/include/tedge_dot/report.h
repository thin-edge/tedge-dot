/* tedge-dot C SDK — the reporting policy (report by exception, contract §5.3).
 *
 * A point's `report` table decides which of its readings are published: only
 * changes, only changes beyond a deadband, at most once per interval, once a
 * change has settled -- and a heartbeat that still publishes a fresh reading
 * when nothing changes. The runtime applies it in front of the sample topic,
 * so every connector behaves alike and no module filters.
 *
 * tdot_report_state_t is the per-point state machine. It is pure -- no clock,
 * no MQTT -- so the runtime drives it with the monotonic time and the shared
 * test vectors (doc/contract/test-vectors/report/) drive it in
 * impl/c/tests/report.c. It implements exactly the rules of the Rust SDK's
 * impl/rust/crates/sdk/src/report.rs, in the same order; the vectors are what
 * keeps the two identical.
