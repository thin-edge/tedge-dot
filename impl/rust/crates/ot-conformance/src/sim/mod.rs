//! Protocol simulators for the behavioural layer.

//! One trait, one built-in implementation per protocol. A simulator is seeded from the
//! manifest's `[simulator] seed` file, serves the real protocol on a loopback port, and gives
//! the harness ground truth: the bytes a point should read, whether an address is seeded
//! invalid, which writes arrived, and an outage switch for the link-drop check (B5).
